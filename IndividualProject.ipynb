    "California literature includes extensive writings on the topic of the environment, American settlers, and Native peoples. The common theme of aridity unites all three. Mary Hunter Austin was an early nature writer of the American Southwest, best known for her book The Land of Little Rain, published in 1903. She came to the San Joaquin Valley with her family in 1888 and subsequently wrote about her experiences. Her writing reflects her interests in the Mojave desert, the aridity of the California environment, debates around California water rights, and Native American rights. Austin’s work today reveals changing attitudes at the turn of the century around the environment, the place of Native peoples, and conservation. An examination of The Land of Little Rain may indicate larger trends in early 20th century California literature and the emerging conservation movement, particularly as it regards deserts."

    "2) What can textual analysis targeting the frequency of language signal about the text’s core themes; the supremacy and divinity of nature, the negative consequences of the disconnect between humans and nature, and the positive consequences of the harmony between humans and nature?"

They see feminist theory as an important way to correct the exclusion of women in data and by extension data science.

    "\n",
    "K. Rawson and T. Muñoz caution that data cleaning requires more careful consideration. As a process, it has multiple interpretations and no single standard. Data cleaning is often presented as an objective process while in fact implemented through highly subjective standards. Particularly in the humanities, paradigms for data cleaning have yet to be established and are not easily imported from other fields, \"without risking the foreclosure of specific and valuable humanistic modes of producing knowledge.\" Rawson and Muñoz speculate on alternative approaches to resolve the reductiveness of data cleaning in the humanities. Indexes are one way they propose for making scalability explicit while preserving diversity."

       "'THE LAND OF LITTLE RAIN\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nEast away from the Sierras, south from Panamint and Amargosa, east and\\nsouth many an uncounted mile, is the Country of Lost Borders.\\n\\nUte, Paiute, Mojave, and Shoshone inhabit its frontiers, and as far\\ninto the heart of it as a man dare go. Not the law, but the land sets\\nthe limit. Desert is the name it wears upon the maps, but the Indian’s\\nis the better word. Desert is a loose term to indicate land that\\nsupports no man; whether the land can be bitted and broken to that\\npurpose is not proven. Void of life it never is, however dry the air\\nand villainous the soil.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThis is the nature of that country. There are hills, rounded, blunt,\\nburned, squeezed up out of chaos, chrome and vermilion painted,\\naspiring to the snow-line. Between the hills lie high level-looking\\nplains full of intolerable sun glare, or narrow valleys drowned in\\na blue haze. The hill surface is streaked with ash drift and black,\\nunweathered lava flows. After rains water accumulates in the hollows of\\nsmall closed valleys, and, evaporating, leaves hard dry levels of pure\\ndesertness that get the local name of dry lakes. Where the mountains\\nare steep and the rains heavy, the pool is never quite dry, but dark\\nand bitter, rimmed about with the efflorescence of alkaline deposits. A\\nthin crust of it lies along the marsh over the vegetating area, which\\nhas neither beauty nor freshness. In the broad wastes open to the wind\\nthe sand drifts in hummocks about the stubby shrubs, and between them\\nthe soil shows saline traces. The sculpture of the hills here is more\\nwind than water work, though the quick storms do sometimes scar them\\npast many a year’s redeeming. In all the Western desert edges there are\\nessays in miniature at the famed, terrible Grand Cañon, to which, if\\nyou keep on long enough in this country, you will come at last.\\n\\nSince this is a hill country one expects to find springs, but not\\nto depend upon them; for when found they are often brackish and\\nunwholesome, or maddening, slow dribbles in a thirsty soil. Here you\\nfind the hot sink of Death Valley, or high rolling districts where\\nthe air has always a tang of frost. Here are the long heavy winds and\\nbreathless calms on the tilted mesas where dust devils dance, whirling\\nup into a wide, pale sky. Here you have no rain when all the earth\\ncries for it, or quick downpours called cloud-bursts for violence. A\\nland of lost rivers, with little in it to love; yet a land that once\\nvisited must be come back to inevitably. If it were not so there would\\nbe little told of it.\\n\\nThis is the country of three seasons. From June on to November it lies\\nhot, still, and unbearable, sick with violent unrelieving storms; then\\non until April, chill, quiescent, drinking its scant rain and scanter\\nsnows; from April to the hot season again, blossoming, radiant, and\\nseductive. These months are only approximate; later or earlier the\\nrain-laden wind may drift up the water gate of the Colorado from the\\nGulf, and the land sets its seasons by the rain.\\n\\nThe desert floras shame us with their cheerful adaptations to the\\nseasonal limitations. Their whole duty is to flower and fruit, and\\nthey do it hardly, or with tropical luxuriance, as the rain admits. It\\nis recorded in the report of the Death Valley expedition that after a\\nyear of abundant rains, on the Colorado desert was found a specimen of\\nAmaranthus ten feet high. A year later the same species in the same\\nplace matured in the drought at four inches. One hopes the land may\\nbreed like qualities in her human offspring, not tritely to “try,” but\\nto do. Seldom does the desert herb attain the full stature of the type.\\nExtreme aridity and extreme altitude have the same dwarfing effect, so\\nthat we find in the high Sierras and in Death Valley related species in\\nminiature that reach a comely growth in mean temperatures. Very fertile\\nare the desert plants in expedients to prevent evaporation, turning\\ntheir foliage edgewise toward the sun, growing silky hairs, exuding\\nviscid gum. The wind, which has a long sweep, harries and helps them.\\nIt rolls up dunes about the stocky stems, encompassing and protective,\\nand above the dunes, which may be, as with the mesquite, three times as\\nhigh as a man, the blossoming twigs flourish and bear fruit.\\n\\nThere are many areas in the desert where drinkable water lies within\\na few feet of the surface, indicated by the mesquite and the bunch\\ngrass (_Sporobolus airoides_). It is this nearness of unimagined help\\nthat makes the tragedy of desert deaths. It is related that the final\\nbreakdown of that hapless party that gave Death Valley its forbidding\\nname occurred in a locality where shallow wells would have saved them.\\nBut how were they to know that? Properly equipped it is possible to\\ngo safely across that ghastly sink, yet every year it takes its toll\\nof death, and yet men find there sun-dried mummies, of whom no trace\\nor recollection is preserved. To underestimate one’s thirst, to pass\\na given landmark to the right or left, to find a dry spring where one\\nlooked for running water--there is no help for any of these things.\\n\\nAlong springs and sunken watercourses one is surprised to find such\\nwater-loving plants as grow widely in moist ground, but the true desert\\nbreeds its own kind, each in its particular habitat. The angle of the\\nslope, the frontage of a hill, the structure of the soil determines the\\nplant. South-looking hills are nearly bare, and the lower tree-line\\nhigher here by a thousand feet. Cañons running east and west will\\nhave one wall naked and one clothed. Around dry lakes and marshes the\\nherbage preserves a set and orderly arrangement. Most species have\\nwell-defined areas of growth, the best index the voiceless land can\\ngive the traveler of his whereabouts.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIf you have any doubt about it, know that the desert begins with the\\ncreosote. This immortal shrub spreads down into Death Valley and up to\\nthe lower timber-line, odorous and medicinal as you might guess from\\nthe name, wandlike, with shining fretted foliage. Its vivid green is\\ngrateful to the eye in a wilderness of gray and greenish white shrubs.\\nIn the spring it exudes a resinous gum which the Indians of those parts\\nknow how to use with pulverized rock for cementing arrow points to\\nshafts. Trust Indians not to miss any virtues of the plant world!\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nNothing the desert produces expresses it better than the unhappy growth\\nof the tree yuccas. Tormented, thin forests of it stalk drearily in\\nthe high mesas, particularly in that triangular slip that fans out\\neastward from the meeting of the Sierras and coastwise hills where\\nthe first swings across the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley.\\nThe yucca bristles with bayonet-pointed leaves, dull green, growing\\nshaggy with age, tipped with panicles of fetid, greenish bloom. After\\ndeath, which is slow, the ghostly hollow network of its woody skeleton,\\nwith hardly power to rot, makes the moonlight fearful. Before the\\nyucca has come to flower, while yet its bloom is a creamy cone-shaped\\nbud of the size of a small cabbage, full of sugary sap, the Indians\\ntwist it deftly out of its fence of daggers and roast it for their\\nown delectation. So it is that in those parts where man inhabits one\\nsees young plants of _Yucca arborensis_ infrequently. Other yuccas,\\ncacti, low herbs, a thousand sorts, one finds journeying east from\\nthe coastwise hills. There is neither poverty of soil nor species to\\naccount for the sparseness of desert growth, but simply that each plant\\nrequires more room. So much earth must be preëmpted to extract so much\\nmoisture. The real struggle for existence, the real brain of the plant,\\nis underground; above there is room for a rounded perfect growth. In\\nDeath Valley, reputed the very core of desolation, are nearly two\\nhundred identified species.\\n\\nAbove the lower tree-line, which is also the snow-line, mapped out\\nabruptly by the sun, one finds spreading growth of piñon, juniper,\\nbranched nearly to the ground, lilac and sage, and scattering white\\npines.\\n\\nThere is no special preponderance of self-fertilized or\\nwind-fertilized plants, but everywhere the demand for and evidence\\nof insect life. Now where there are seeds and insects there will be\\nbirds and small mammals, and where these are, will come the slinking,\\nsharp-toothed kind that prey on them. Go as far as you dare in the\\nheart of a lonely land, you cannot go so far that life and death are\\nnot before you. Painted lizards slip in and out of rock crevices, and\\npant on the white hot sands. Birds, hummingbirds even, nest in the\\ncactus scrub; woodpeckers befriend the demoniac yuccas; out of the\\nstark, treeless waste rings the music of the night-singing mockingbird.\\nIf it be summer and the sun well down, there will be a burrowing owl\\nto call. Strange, furry, tricksy things dart across the open places,\\nor sit motionless in the conning towers of the creosote. The poet may\\nhave “named all the birds without a gun,” but not the fairy-footed,\\nground-inhabiting, furtive, small folk of the rainless regions. They\\nare too many and too swift; how many you would not believe without\\nseeing the footprint tracings in the sand. They are nearly all night\\nworkers, finding the days too hot and white. In mid-desert where there\\nare no cattle, there are no birds of carrion, but if you go far in\\nthat direction the chances are that you will find yourself shadowed by\\ntheir tilted wings. Nothing so large as a man can move unspied upon in\\nthat country, and they know well how the land deals with strangers.\\nThere are hints to be had here of the way in which a land forces new\\nhabits on its dwellers. The quick increase of suns at the end of spring\\nsometimes overtakes birds in their nesting and effects a reversal of\\nthe ordinary manner of incubation. It becomes necessary to keep eggs\\ncool rather than warm. One hot, stifling spring in the Little Antelope\\nI had occasion to pass and repass frequently the nest of a pair of\\nmeadowlarks, located unhappily in the shelter of a very slender weed. I\\nnever caught them sitting except near night, but at midday they stood,\\nor drooped above it, half fainting with pitifully parted bills, between\\ntheir treasure and the sun. Sometimes both of them together with wings\\nspread and half lifted continued a spot of shade in a temperature\\nthat constrained me at last in a fellow feeling to spare them a bit\\nof canvas for permanent shelter. There was a fence in that country\\nshutting in a cattle range, and along its fifteen miles of posts one\\ncould be sure of finding a bird or two in every strip of shadow;\\nsometimes the sparrow and the hawk, with wings trailed and beaks\\nparted, drooping in the white truce of noon.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIf one is inclined to wonder at first how so many dwellers came to be\\nin the loneliest land that ever came out of God’s hands, what they do\\nthere and why stay, one does not wonder so much after having lived\\nthere. None other than this long brown land lays such a hold on the\\naffections. The rainbow hills, the tender bluish mists, the luminous\\nradiance of the spring, have the lotus charm. They trick the sense\\nof time, so that once inhabiting there you always mean to go away\\nwithout quite realizing that you have not done it. Men who have lived\\nthere, miners and cattle-men, will tell you this, not so fluently, but\\nemphatically, cursing the land and going back to it. For one thing\\nthere is the divinest, cleanest air to be breathed anywhere in God’s\\nworld. Some day the world will understand that, and the little oases on\\nthe windy tops of hills will harbor for healing its ailing, house-weary\\nbroods. There is promise there of great wealth in ores and earths,\\nwhich is no wealth by reason of being so far removed from water and\\nworkable conditions, but men are bewitched by it and tempted to try the\\nimpossible.\\n\\nYou should hear Salty Williams tell how he used to drive eighteen and\\ntwenty-mule teams from the borax marsh to Mojave, ninety miles, with\\nthe trail wagon full of water barrels. Hot days the mules would go\\nso mad for drink that the clank of the water bucket set them into an\\nuproar of hideous, maimed noises, and a tangle of harness chains, while\\nSalty would sit on the high seat with the sun glare heavy in his eyes,\\ndealing out curses of pacification in a level, uninterested voice until\\nthe clamor fell off from sheer exhaustion. There was a line of shallow\\ngraves along that road; they used to count on dropping a man or two\\nof every new gang of coolies brought out in the hot season. But when\\nhe lost his swamper, smitten without warning at the noon halt, Salty\\nquit his job; he said it was “too durn hot.” The swamper he buried by\\nthe way with stones upon him to keep the coyotes from digging him up,\\nand seven years later I read the penciled lines on the pine headboard,\\nstill bright and unweathered.\\n\\nBut before that, driving up on the Mojave stage, I met Salty again\\ncrossing Indian Wells, his face from the high seat, tanned and ruddy\\nas a harvest moon, looming through the golden dust above his eighteen\\nmules. The land had called him.\\n\\nThe palpable sense of mystery in the desert air breeds fables, chiefly\\nof lost treasure. Somewhere within its stark borders, if one believes\\nreport, is a hill strewn with nuggets; one seamed with virgin silver;\\nan old clayey water-bed where Indians scooped up earth to make cooking\\npots and shaped them reeking with grains of pure gold. Old miners\\ndrifting about the desert edges, weathered into the semblance of the\\ntawny hills, will tell you tales like these convincingly. After a\\nlittle sojourn in that land you will believe them on their own account.\\nIt is a question whether it is not better to be bitten by the little\\nhorned snake of the desert that goes sidewise and strikes without\\ncoiling, than by the tradition of a lost mine.\\n\\nAnd yet--and yet--is it not perhaps to satisfy expectation that one\\nfalls into the tragic key in writing of desertness? The more you wish\\nof it the more you get, and in the mean time lose much of pleasantness.\\nIn that country which begins at the foot of the east slope of the\\nSierras and spreads out by less and less lofty hill ranges toward the\\nGreat Basin, it is possible to live with great zest, to have red blood\\nand delicate joys, to pass and repass about one’s daily performance\\nan area that would make an Atlantic seaboard State, and that with no\\nperil, and, according to our way of thought, no particular difficulty.\\nAt any rate, it was not people who went into the desert merely to write\\nit up who invented the fabled Hassaympa, of whose waters, if any drink,\\nthey can no more see fact as naked fact, but all radiant with the color\\nof romance. I, who must have drunk of it in my twice seven years’\\nwanderings, am assured that it is worth while.\\n\\nFor all the toll the desert takes of a man it gives compensations,\\ndeep breaths, deep sleep, and the communion of the stars. It comes\\nupon one with new force in the pauses of the night that the Chaldeans\\nwere a desert-bred people. It is hard to escape the sense of mastery\\nas the stars move in the wide clear heavens to risings and settings\\nunobscured. They look large and near and palpitant; as if they moved on\\nsome stately service not needful to declare. Wheeling to their stations\\nin the sky, they make the poor world-fret of no account. Of no account\\nyou who lie out there watching, nor the lean coyote that stands off in\\nthe scrub from you and howls and howls.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWATER TRAILS OF THE CERISO\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nBy the end of the dry season the water trails of the Ceriso are worn\\nto a white ribbon in the leaning grass, spread out faint and fan wise\\ntoward the homes of gopher and ground rat and squirrel. But however\\nfaint to man-sight, they are sufficiently plain to the furred and\\nfeathered folk who travel them. Getting down to the eye level of rat\\nand squirrel kind, one perceives what might easily be wide and winding\\nroads to us if they occurred in thick plantations of trees three times\\nthe height of a man. It needs but a slender thread of barrenness to\\nmake a mouse trail in the forest of the sod. To the little people the\\nwater trails are as country roads, with scents as signboards.\\n\\nIt seems that man-height is the least fortunate of all heights from\\nwhich to study trails. It is better to go up the front of some tall\\nhill, say the spur of Black Mountain, looking back and down across the\\nhollow of the Ceriso. Strange how long the soil keeps the impression\\nof any continuous treading, even after grass has overgrown it. Twenty\\nyears since, a brief heyday of mining at Black Mountain made a stage\\nroad across the Ceriso, yet the parallel lines that are the wheel\\ntraces show from the height dark and well defined. Afoot in the Ceriso\\none looks in vain for any sign of it. So all the paths that wild\\ncreatures use going down to the Lone Tree Spring are mapped out whitely\\nfrom this level, which is also the level of the hawks.\\n\\nThere is little water in the Ceriso at the best of times, and that\\nlittle brackish and smelling vilely, but by a lone juniper where\\nthe rim of the Ceriso breaks away to the lower country, there is a\\nperpetual rill of fresh sweet drink in the midst of lush grass and\\nwatercress. In the dry season there is no water else for a man’s long\\njourney of a day. East to the foot of Black Mountain, and north and\\nsouth without counting, are the burrows of small rodents, rat and\\nsquirrel kind. Under the sage are the shallow forms of the jackrabbits,\\nand in the dry banks of washes, and among the strewn fragments of black\\nrock, lairs of bobcat, fox, and coyote.\\n\\nThe coyote is your true water-witch, one who snuffs and paws, snuffs\\nand paws again at the smallest spot of moisture-scented earth until he\\nhas freed the blind water from the soil. Many water-holes are no more\\nthan this detected by the lean hobo of the hills in localities where\\nnot even an Indian would look for it.\\n\\nIt is the opinion of many wise and busy people that the hill-folk pass\\nthe ten-month interval between the end and renewal of winter rains,\\nwith no drink; but your true idler, with days and nights to spend\\nbeside the water trails, will not subscribe to it. The trails begin,\\nas I said, very far back in the Ceriso, faintly, and converge in one\\nspan broad, white, hard-trodden way in the gully of the spring. And why\\ntrails if there are no travelers in that direction?\\n\\nI have yet to find the land not scarred by the thin, far roadways of\\nrabbits and what not of furry folks that run in them. Venture to look\\nfor some seldom-touched water-hole, and so long as the trails run with\\nyour general direction make sure you are right, but if they begin to\\ncross yours at never so slight an angle, to converge toward a point\\nleft or right of your objective, no matter what the maps say, or your\\nmemory, trust them; they _know_.\\n\\nIt is very still in the Ceriso by day, so that were it not for the\\nevidence of those white beaten ways, it might be the desert it looks.\\nThe sun is hot in the dry season, and the days are filled with the\\nglare of it. Now and again some unseen coyote signals his pack in a\\nlong-drawn, dolorous whine that comes from no determinate point, but\\nnothing stirs much before mid-afternoon. It is a sign when there begin\\nto be hawks skimming above the sage that the little people are going\\nabout their business.\\n\\nWe have fallen on a very careless usage, speaking of wild creatures as\\nif they were bound by some such limitation as hampers clockwork. When\\nwe say of one and another, they are night prowlers, it is perhaps true\\nonly as the things they feed upon are more easily come by in the dark,\\nand they know well how to adjust themselves to conditions wherein food\\nis more plentiful by day. And their accustomed performance is very much\\na matter of keen eye, keener scent, quick ear, and a better memory of\\nsights and sounds than man dares boast. Watch a coyote come out of his\\nlair and cast about in his mind where he will go for his daily killing.\\nYou cannot very well tell what decides him, but very easily that he has\\ndecided. He trots or breaks into short gallops, with very perceptible\\npauses to look up and about at landmarks, alters his tack a little,\\nlooking forward and back to steer his proper course. I am persuaded\\nthat the coyotes in my valley, which is narrow and beset with steep,\\nsharp hills, in long passages steer by the pinnacles of the sky-line,\\ngoing with head cocked to one side to keep to the left or right of such\\nand such a promontory.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nI have trailed a coyote often, going across country, perhaps to where\\nsome slant-winged scavenger hanging in the air signaled prospect of\\na dinner, and found his track such as a man, a very intelligent man\\naccustomed to a hill country, and a little cautious, would make to\\nthe same point. Here a detour to avoid a stretch of too little cover,\\nthere a pause on the rim of a gully to pick the better way,--and it is\\nusually the best way,--and making his point with the greatest economy\\nof effort. Since the time of Seyavi the deer have shifted their feeding\\nground across the valley at the beginning of deep snows, by way of the\\nBlack Rock, fording the river at Charley’s Butte, and making straight\\nfor the mouth of the cañon that is the easiest going to the winter\\npastures on Waban. So they still cross, though whatever trail they had\\nhas been long broken by ploughed ground; but from the mouth of Tinpah\\nCreek, where the deer come out of the Sierras, it is easily seen that\\nthe creek, the point of Black Rock, and Charley’s Butte are in line\\nwith the wide bulk of shade that is the foot of Waban Pass. And along\\nwith this the deer have learned that Charley’s Butte is almost the only\\npossible ford, and all the shortest crossing of the valley. It seems\\nthat the wild creatures have learned all that is important to their\\nway of life except the changes of the moon. I have seen some prowling\\nfox or coyote, surprised by its sudden rising from behind the mountain\\nwall, slink in its increasing glow, watch it furtively from the cover\\nof near-by brush, unprepared and half uncertain of its identity until\\nit rode clear of the peaks, and finally make off with all the air of\\none caught napping by an ancient joke. The moon in its wanderings\\nmust be a sort of exasperation to cunning beasts, likely to spoil by\\nuntimely risings some fore-planned mischief.\\n\\nBut to take the trail again; the coyotes that are astir in the Ceriso\\nof late afternoons, harrying the rabbits from their shallow forms,\\nand the hawks that sweep and swing above them, are not there from\\nany mechanical promptings of instinct, but because they know of old\\nexperience that the small fry are about to take to seed gathering and\\nthe water trails. The rabbits begin it, taking the trail with long,\\nlight leaps, one eye and ear cocked to the hills from whence a coyote\\nmight descend upon them at any moment. Rabbits are a foolish people.\\nThey do not fight except with their own kind, nor use their paws except\\nfor feet, and appear to have no reason for existence but to furnish\\nmeals for meat-eaters. In flight they seem to rebound from the earth\\nof their own elasticity, but keep a sober pace going to the spring. It\\nis the young watercress that tempts them and the pleasures of society,\\nfor they seldom drink. Even in localities where there are flowing\\nstreams they seem to prefer the moisture that collects on herbage, and\\nafter rains may be seen rising on their haunches to drink delicately\\nthe clear drops caught in the tops of the young sage. But drink they\\nmust, as I have often seen them mornings and evenings at the rill that\\ngoes by my door. Wait long enough at the Lone Tree Spring and sooner or\\nlater they will all come in. But here their matings are accomplished,\\nand though they are fearful of so little as a cloud shadow or blown\\nleaf, they contrive to have some playful hours. At the spring the\\nbobcat drops down upon them from the black rock, and the red fox picks\\nthem up returning in the dark. By day the hawk and eagle overshadow\\nthem, and the coyote has all times and seasons for his own.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nCattle, when there are any in the Ceriso, drink morning and evening,\\nspending the night on the warm last lighted slopes of neighboring\\nhills, stirring with the peep o’ day. In these half wild spotted\\nsteers the habits of an earlier lineage persist. It must be long since\\nthey have made beds for themselves, but before lying down they turn\\nthemselves round and round as dogs do. They choose bare and stony\\nground, exposed fronts of westward facing hills, and lie down in\\ncompanies. Usually by the end of the summer the cattle have been driven\\nor gone of their own choosing to the mountain meadows. One year a\\nmaverick yearling, strayed or overlooked by the vaqueros, kept on until\\nthe season’s end, and so betrayed another visitor to the spring that\\nelse I might have missed. On a certain morning the half-eaten carcass\\nlay at the foot of the black rock, and in moist earth by the rill of\\nthe spring, the foot-pads of a cougar, puma, mountain lion, or whatever\\nthe beast is rightly called. The kill must have been made early in the\\nevening, for it appeared that the cougar had been twice to the spring;\\nand since the meat-eater drinks little until he has eaten, he must have\\nfed and drunk, and after an interval of lying up in the black rock, had\\neaten and drunk again. There was no knowing how far he had come, but\\nif he came again the second night he found that the coyotes had left\\nhim very little of his kill.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nNobody ventures to say how infrequently and at what hour the small\\nfry visit the spring. There are such numbers of them that if each\\ncame once between the last of spring and the first of winter rains,\\nthere would still be water trails. I have seen badgers drinking about\\nthe hour when the light takes on the yellow tinge it has from coming\\nslantwise through the hills. They find out shallow places, and are\\nloath to wet their feet. Rats and chipmunks have been observed visiting\\nthe spring as late as nine o’clock mornings. The larger spermophiles\\nthat live near the spring and keep awake to work all day, come and\\ngo at no particular hour, drinking sparingly. At long intervals on\\nhalf-lighted days, meadow and field mice steal delicately along the\\ntrail. These visitors are all too small to be watched carefully at\\nnight, but for evidence of their frequent coming there are the trails\\nthat may be traced miles out among the crisping grasses. On rare\\nnights, in the places where no grass grows between the shrubs, and the\\nsand silvers whitely to the moon, one sees them whisking to and fro\\non innumerable errands of seed gathering, but the chief witnesses of\\ntheir presence near the spring are the elf owls. Those burrow-haunting,\\nspeckled fluffs of greediness begin a twilight flitting toward the\\nspring, feeding as they go on grasshoppers, lizards, and small, swift\\ncreatures, diving into burrows to catch field mice asleep, battling\\nwith chipmunks at their own doors, and getting down in great numbers\\ntoward the lone juniper. Now owls do not love water greatly on its own\\naccount. Not to my knowledge have I caught one drinking or bathing,\\nthough on night wanderings across the mesa they flit up from under the\\nhorse’s feet along stream borders. Their presence near the spring in\\ngreat numbers would indicate the presence of the things they feed upon.\\nAll night the rustle and soft hooting keeps on in the neighborhood of\\nthe spring, with seldom small shrieks of mortal agony. It is clear day\\nbefore they have all gotten back to their particular hummocks, and if\\none follows cautiously, not to frighten them into some near-by burrow,\\nit is possible to trail them far up the slope.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe crested quail that troop in the Ceriso are the happiest frequenters\\nof the water trails. There is no furtiveness about their morning\\ndrink. About the time the burrowers and all that feed upon them are\\naddressing themselves to sleep, great flocks pour down the trails with\\nthat peculiar melting motion of moving quail, twittering, shoving, and\\nshouldering. They splatter into the shallows, drink daintily, shake out\\nsmall showers over their perfect coats, and melt away again into the\\nscrub, preening and pranking, with soft contented noises.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAfter the quail, sparrows and ground-inhabiting birds bathe with\\nthe utmost frankness and a great deal of splutter; and here in the\\nheart of noon hawks resort, sitting panting, with wings aslant, and a\\ntruce to all hostilities because of the heat. One summer there came\\na road-runner up from the lower valley, peeking and prying, and he\\nhad never any patience with the water baths of the sparrows. His own\\nablutions were performed in the clean, hopeful dust of the chaparral;\\nand whenever he happened on their morning splatterings, he would\\ndepress his glossy crest, slant his shining tail to the level of his\\nbody, until he looked most like some bright venomous snake, daunting\\nthem with shrill abuse and feint of battle. Then suddenly he would go\\ntilting and balancing down the gully in fine disdain, only to return in\\na day or two to make sure the foolish bodies were still at it.\\n\\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\\n\\nOut on the Ceriso about five miles, and wholly out of sight of it,\\nnear where the immemorial foot trail goes up from Saline Flat toward\\nBlack Mountain, is a water sign worth turning out of the trail to see.\\nIt is a laid circle of stones large enough not to be disturbed by any\\nordinary hap, with an opening flanked by two parallel rows of similar\\nstones, between which were an arrow placed, touching the opposite rim\\nof the circle, thus (Fig. 1), it would point as the crow flies to the\\nspring. It is the old, indubitable water mark of the Shoshones. One\\nstill finds it in the desert ranges in Salt Wells and Mesquite valleys,\\nand along the slopes of Waban. On the other side of Ceriso, where the\\nblack rock begins, about a mile from the spring, is the work of an\\nolder, forgotten people. The rock hereabout is all volcanic, fracturing\\nwith a crystalline whitish surface, but weathered outside to furnace\\nblackness. Around the spring, where must have been a gathering place\\nof the tribes, it is scored over with strange pictures and symbols\\nthat have no meaning to the Indians of the present day; but out where\\nthe rock begins, there is carved into the white heart of it a pointing\\narrow over the symbol for distance and a circle full of wavy lines\\n(Fig. 2) reading thus: “In this direction three [units of measurement\\nunknown] is a spring of sweet water; look for it.”\\n\\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SCAVENGERS\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nFifty-seven buzzards, one on each of fifty-seven fence posts at the\\nrancho El Tejon, on a mirage-breeding September morning, sat solemnly\\nwhile the white tilted travelers’ vans lumbered down the Canada de los\\nUvas. After three hours they had only clapped their wings, or exchanged\\nposts. The season’s end in the vast dim valley of the San Joaquin is\\npalpitatingly hot, and the air breathes like cotton wool. Through it\\nall the buzzards sit on the fences and low hummocks, with wings spread\\nfanwise for air. There is no end to them, and they smell to heaven.\\nTheir heads droop, and all their communication is a rare, horrid croak.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe increase of wild creatures is in proportion to the things they\\nfeed upon: the more carrion the more buzzards. The end of the third\\nsuccessive dry year bred them beyond belief. The first year quail\\nmated sparingly; the second year the wild oats matured no seed; the\\nthird, cattle died in their tracks with their heads towards the stopped\\nwatercourses. And that year the scavengers were as black as the plague\\nall across the mesa and up the treeless, tumbled hills. On clear days\\nthey betook themselves to the upper air, where they hung motionless for\\nhours. That year there were vultures among them, distinguished by the\\nwhite patches under the wings. All their offensiveness notwithstanding,\\nthey have a stately flight. They must also have what pass for good\\nqualities among themselves, for they are social, not to say clannish.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt is a very squalid tragedy,--that of the dying brutes and the\\nscavenger birds. Death by starvation is slow. The heavy-headed,\\nrack-boned cattle totter in the fruitless trails; they stand for\\nlong, patient intervals; they lie down and do not rise. There is\\nfear in their eyes when they are first stricken, but afterward only\\nintolerable weariness. I suppose the dumb creatures know nearly as\\nmuch of death as do their betters, who have only the more imagination.\\nTheir even-breathing submission after the first agony is their tribute\\nto its inevitableness. It needs a nice discrimination to say which of\\nthe basket-ribbed cattle is likest to afford the next meal, but the\\nscavengers make few mistakes. One stoops to the quarry and the flock\\nfollows.\\n\\nCattle once down may be days in dying. They stretch out their necks\\nalong the ground, and roll up their slow eyes at longer intervals. The\\nbuzzards have all the time, and no beak is dropped or talon struck\\nuntil the breath is wholly passed. It is doubtless the economy of\\nnature to have the scavengers by to clean up the carrion, but a wolf at\\nthe throat would be a shorter agony than the long stalking and sometime\\nperchings of these loathsome watchers. Suppose now it were a man in\\nthis long-drawn, hungrily spied upon distress! When Timmie O’Shea was\\nlost on Armogossa Flats for three days without water, Long Tom Basset\\nfound him, not by any trail, but by making straight away for the points\\nwhere he saw buzzards stooping. He could hear the beat of their wings,\\nTom said, and trod on their shadows, but O’Shea was past recalling what\\nhe thought about things after the second day. My friend Ewan told\\nme, among other things, when he came back from San Juan Hill, that not\\nall the carnage of battle turned his bowels as the sight of slant black\\nwings rising flockwise before the burial squad.\\n\\n[Illustration: LOST FOR THREE DAYS IN THE DESERT]\\n\\nThere are three kinds of noises buzzards make,--it is impossible to\\ncall them notes,--raucous and elemental. There is a short croak of\\nalarm, and the same syllable in a modified tone to serve all the\\npurposes of ordinary conversation. The old birds make a kind of throaty\\nchuckling to their young, but if they have any love song I have not\\nheard it. The young yawp in the nest a little, with more breath than\\nnoise. It is seldom one finds a buzzard’s nest, seldom that grown-ups\\nfind a nest of any sort; it is only children to whom these things\\nhappen by right. But by making a business of it one may come upon\\nthem in wide, quiet cañons, or on the lookouts of lonely, table-topped\\nmountains, three or four together, in the tops of stubby trees or on\\nrotten cliffs well open to the sky.\\n\\nIt is probable that the buzzard is gregarious, but it seems unlikely\\nfrom the small number of young noted at any time that every female\\nincubates each year. The young birds are easily distinguished by their\\nsize when feeding, and high up in air by the worn primaries of the\\nolder birds. It is when the young go out of the nest on their first\\nforaging that the parents, full of a crass and simple pride, make their\\nindescribable chucklings of gobbling, gluttonous delight. The little\\nones would be amusing as they tug and tussle, if one could forget what\\nit is they feed upon.\\n\\nOne never comes any nearer to the vulture’s nest or nestlings than\\nhearsay. They keep to the southerly Sierras, and are bold enough, it\\nseems, to do killing on their own account when no carrion is at hand.\\nThey dog the shepherd from camp to camp, the hunter home from the hill,\\nand will even carry away offal from under his hand.\\n\\nThe vulture merits respect for his bigness and for his bandit airs, but\\nhe is a sombre bird, with none of the buzzard’s frank satisfaction in\\nhis offensiveness.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe least objectionable of the inland scavengers is the raven,\\nfrequenter of the desert ranges, the same called locally “carrion\\ncrow.” He is handsomer and has such an air. He is nice in his habits\\nand is said to have likable traits. A tame one in a Shoshone camp was\\nthe butt of much sport and enjoyed it. He could all but talk and was\\nanother with the children, but an arrant thief. The raven will eat\\nmost things that come his way,--eggs and young of ground-nesting birds,\\nseeds even, lizards and grasshoppers, which he catches cleverly; and\\nwhatever he is about, let a coyote trot never so softly by, the raven\\nflaps up and after; for whatever the coyote can pull down or nose out\\nis meat also for the carrion crow.\\n\\nAnd never a coyote comes out of his lair for killing, in the country\\nof the carrion crows, but looks up first to see where they may be\\ngathering. It is a sufficient occupation for a windy morning, on the\\nlineless, level mesa, to watch the pair of them eying each other\\nfurtively, with a tolerable assumption of unconcern, but no doubt with\\na certain amount of good understanding about it. Once at Red Rock, in a\\nyear of green pasture, which is a bad time for the scavengers, we saw\\ntwo buzzards, five ravens, and a coyote feeding on the same carrion,\\nand only the coyote seemed ashamed of the company.\\n\\nProbably we never fully credit the interdependence of wild creatures,\\nand their cognizance of the affairs of their own kind. When the five\\ncoyotes that range the Tejon from Pasteria to Tunawai planned a relay\\nrace to bring down an antelope strayed from the band, beside myself\\nto watch, an eagle swung down from Mt. Pinos, buzzards materialized\\nout of invisible ether, and hawks came trooping like small boys to a\\nstreet fight. Rabbits sat up in the chaparral and cocked their ears,\\nfeeling themselves quite safe for the once as the hunt swung near them.\\nNothing happens in the deep wood that the blue jays are not all agog\\nto tell. The hawk follows the badger, the coyote the carrion crow,\\nand from their aerial stations the buzzards watch each other. What\\nwould be worth knowing is how much of their neighbor’s affairs the new\\ngenerations learn for themselves, and how much they are taught of their\\nelders.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nSo wide is the range of the scavengers that it is never safe to say,\\neyewitness to the contrary, that there are few or many in such a place.\\nWhere the carrion is, there will the buzzards be gathered together,\\nand in three days’ journey you will not sight another one. The way up\\nfrom Mojave to Red Butte is all desertness, affording no pasture and\\nscarcely a rill of water. In a year of little rain in the south, flocks\\nand herds were driven to the number of thousands along this road to\\nthe perennial pastures of the high ranges. It is a long, slow trail,\\nankle deep in bitter dust that gets up in the slow wind and moves along\\nthe backs of the crawling cattle. In the worst of times one in three\\nwill pine and fall out by the way. In the defiles of Red Rock, the\\nsheep piled up a stinking lane; it was the sun smiting by day. To these\\nshambles came buzzards, vultures, and coyotes from all the country\\nround, so that on the Tejon, the Ceriso, and the Little Antelope there\\nwere not scavengers enough to keep the country clean. All that summer\\nthe dead mummified in the open or dropped slowly back to earth in the\\nquagmires of the bitter springs. Meanwhile from Red Rock to Coyote\\nHoles, and from Coyote Holes to Haiwai the scavengers gorged and gorged.\\n\\nThe coyote is not a scavenger by choice, preferring his own kill, but\\nbeing on the whole a lazy dog, is apt to fall into carrion eating\\nbecause it is easier. The red fox and bobcat, a little pressed by\\nhunger, will eat of any other animal’s kill, but will not ordinarily\\ntouch what dies of itself, and are exceedingly shy of food that has\\nbeen manhandled.\\n\\nVery clean and handsome, quite belying his relationship in appearance,\\nis Clark’s crow, that scavenger and plunderer of mountain camps. It\\nis permissible to call him by his common name, “Camp Robber:” he has\\nearned it. Not content with refuse, he pecks open meal sacks, filches\\nwhole potatoes, is a gormand for bacon, drills holes in packing cases,\\nand is daunted by nothing short of tin. All the while he does not\\nneglect to vituperate the chipmunks and sparrows that whisk off crumbs\\nof comfort from under the camper’s feet. The Camp Robber’s gray coat,\\nblack and white barred wings, and slender bill, with certain tricks of\\nperching, accuse him of attempts to pass himself off among woodpeckers;\\nbut his behavior is all crow. He frequents the higher pine belts,\\nand has a noisy strident call like a jay’s, and how clean he and the\\nfrisk-tailed chipmunks keep the camp! No crumb or paring or bit of\\neggshell goes amiss.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nHigh as the camp may be, so it is not above timber-line, it is not\\ntoo high for the coyote, the bobcat, or the wolf. It is the complaint\\nof the ordinary camper that the woods are too still, depleted of wild\\nlife. But what dead body of wild thing, or neglected game untouched by\\nits kind, do you find? And put out offal away from camp over night, and\\nlook next day at the foot tracks where it lay.\\n\\nMan is a great blunderer going about in the woods, and there is no\\nother except the bear makes so much noise. Being so well warned\\nbeforehand, it is a very stupid animal, or a very bold one, that cannot\\nkeep safely hid. The cunningest hunter is hunted in turn, and what\\nhe leaves of his kill is meat for some other. That is the economy of\\nnature, but with it all there is not sufficient account taken of the\\nworks of man. There is no scavenger that eats tin cans, and no wild\\nthing leaves a like disfigurement on the forest floor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE POCKET HUNTER\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nI remember very well when I first met him. Walking in the evening glow\\nto spy the marriages of the white gilias, I sniffed the unmistakable\\nodor of burning sage. It is a smell that carries far and indicates\\nusually the nearness of a campoodie, but on the level mesa nothing\\ntaller showed than Diana’s sage. Over the tops of it, beginning to dusk\\nunder a young white moon, trailed a wavering ghost of smoke, and at\\nthe end of it I came upon the Pocket Hunter making a dry camp in the\\nfriendly scrub. He sat tailorwise in the sand, with his coffee-pot on\\nthe coals, his supper ready to hand in the frying-pan, and himself in\\na mood for talk. His pack burros in hobbles strayed off to hunt for a\\nwetter mouthful than the sage afforded, and gave him no concern.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWe came upon him often after that, threading the windy passes, or by\\nwater-holes in the desert hills, and got to know much of his way of\\nlife. He was a small, bowed man, with a face and manner and speech of\\nno character at all, as if he had that faculty of small hunted things\\nof taking on the protective color of his surroundings. His clothes were\\nof no fashion that I could remember, except that they bore liberal\\nmarkings of pot black, and he had a curious fashion of going about\\nwith his mouth open, which gave him a vacant look until you came near\\nenough to perceive him busy about an endless hummed, wordless tune.\\nHe traveled far and took a long time to it, but the simplicity of his\\nkitchen arrangements was elemental. A pot for beans, a coffee-pot, a\\nfrying-pan, a tin to mix bread in--he fed the burros in this when there\\nwas need--with these he had been half round our western world and back.\\nHe explained to me very early in our acquaintance what was good to take\\nto the hills for food: nothing sticky, for that “dirtied the pots;”\\nnothing with “juice” to it, for that would not pack to advantage; and\\nnothing likely to ferment. He used no gun, but he would set snares\\nby the water-holes for quail and doves, and in the trout country he\\ncarried a line. Burros he kept, one or two according to his pack, for\\nthis chief excellence, that they would eat potato parings and firewood.\\nHe had owned a horse in the foothill country, but when he came to\\nthe desert with no forage but mesquite, he found himself under the\\nnecessity of picking the beans from the briers, a labor that drove him\\nto the use of pack animals to whom thorns were a relish.\\n\\nI suppose no man becomes a pocket hunter by first intention. He must be\\nborn with the faculty, and along comes the occasion, like the tap on\\nthe test tube that induces crystallization. My friend had been several\\nthings of no moment until he struck a thousand-dollar pocket in the\\nLee District and came into his vocation. A pocket, you must know, is\\na small body of rich ore occurring by itself, or in a vein of poorer\\nstuff. Nearly every mineral ledge contains such, if only one has the\\nluck to hit upon them without too much labor. The sensible thing for a\\nman to do who has found a good pocket is to buy himself into business\\nand keep away from the hills. The logical thing is to set out looking\\nfor another one. My friend the Pocket Hunter had been looking twenty\\nyears. His working outfit was a shovel, a pick, a gold pan which he\\nkept cleaner than his plate, and a pocket magnifier. When he came to a\\nwatercourse he would pan out the gravel of its bed for “colors,” and\\nunder the glass determine if they had come from far or near, and so\\nspying he would work up the stream until he found where the drift of\\nthe gold-bearing outcrop fanned out into the creek; then up the side\\nof the cañon till he came to the proper vein. I think he said the best\\nindication of small pockets was an iron stain, but I could never get\\nthe run of miner’s talk enough to feel instructed for pocket hunting.\\nHe had another method in the waterless hills, where he would work\\nin and out of blind gullies and all windings of the manifold strata\\nthat appeared not to have cooled since they had been heaved up. His\\nitinerary began with the east slope of the Sierras of the Snows, where\\nthat range swings across to meet the coast hills, and all up that slope\\nto the Truckee River country, where the long cold forbade his progress\\nnorth. Then he worked back down one or another of the nearly parallel\\nranges that lie out desertward, and so down to the sink of the Mojave\\nRiver, burrowing to oblivion in the sand,--a big mysterious land, a\\nlonely, inhospitable land, beautiful, terrible. But he came to no harm\\nin it; the land tolerated him as it might a gopher or a badger. Of all\\nits inhabitants it has the least concern for man.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThere are many strange sorts of humans bred in a mining country, each\\nsort despising the queernesses of the other, but of them all I found\\nthe Pocket Hunter most acceptable for his clean, companionable talk.\\nThere was more color to his reminiscences than the faded sandy old\\nminers “kyoteing,” that is, tunneling like a coyote (kyote in the\\nvernacular) in the core of a lonesome hill. Such a one has found,\\nperhaps, a body of tolerable ore in a poor lead,--remember that I can\\nnever be depended on to get the terms right,--and followed it into the\\nheart of country rock to no profit, hoping, burrowing, and hoping.\\nThese men go harmlessly mad in time, believing themselves just behind\\nthe wall of fortune--most likable and simple men, for whom it is well\\nto do any kindly thing that occurs to you except lend them money. I\\nhave known “grub stakers” too, those persuasive sinners to whom you\\nmake allowances of flour and pork and coffee in consideration of the\\nledges they are about to find; but none of these proved so much worth\\nwhile as the Pocket Hunter. He wanted nothing of you and maintained a\\ncheerful preference for his own way of life. It was an excellent way\\nif you had the constitution for it. The Pocket Hunter had gotten to\\nthat point where he knew no bad weather, and all places were equally\\nhappy so long as they were out of doors. I do not know just how long\\nit takes to become saturated with the elements so that one takes no\\naccount of them. Myself can never get past the glow and exhilaration of\\na storm, the wrestle of long dust-heavy winds, the play of live thunder\\non the rocks, nor past the keen fret of fatigue when the storm outlasts\\nphysical endurance. But prospectors and Indians get a kind of a weather\\nshell that remains on the body until death.\\n\\nThe Pocket Hunter had seen destruction by the violence of nature and\\nthe violence of men, and felt himself in the grip of an All-wisdom\\nthat killed men or spared them as seemed for their good; but of death\\nby sickness he knew nothing except that he believed he should never\\nsuffer it. He had been in Grape-vine Cañon the year of storms that\\nchanged the whole front of the mountain. All day he had come down\\nunder the wing of the storm, hoping to win past it, but finding it\\ntraveling with him until night. It kept on after that, he supposed, a\\nsteady downpour, but could not with certainty say, being securely deep\\nin sleep. But the weather instinct does not sleep. In the night the\\nheavens behind the hill dissolved in rain, and the roar of the storm\\nwas borne in and mixed with his dreaming, so that it moved him, still\\nasleep, to get up and out of the path of it. What finally woke him was\\nthe crash of pine logs as they went down before the unbridled flood,\\nand the swirl of foam that lashed him where he clung in the tangle of\\nscrub while the wall of water went by. It went on against the cabin of\\nBill Gerry and laid Bill stripped and broken on a sand bar at the mouth\\nof the Grape-vine, seven miles away. There, when the sun was up and the\\nwrath of the rain spent, the Pocket Hunter found and buried him; but he\\nnever laid his own escape at any door but the unintelligible favor of\\nthe Powers.\\n\\nThe journeyings of the Pocket Hunter led him often into that mysterious\\ncountry beyond Hot Creek where a hidden force works mischief,\\nmole-like, under the crust of the earth. Whatever agency is at work\\nin that neighborhood, and it is popularly supposed to be the devil,\\nit changes means and direction without time or season. It creeps up\\nwhole hillsides with insidious heat, unguessed until one notes the\\npine woods dying at the top, and having scorched out a good block of\\ntimber returns to steam and spout in caked, forgotten crevices of years\\nbefore. It will break up sometimes blue-hot and bubbling, in the midst\\nof a clear creek, or make a sucking, scalding quicksand at the ford.\\nThese outbreaks had the kind of morbid interest for the Pocket Hunter\\nthat a house of unsavory reputation has in a respectable neighborhood,\\nbut I always found the accounts he brought me more interesting than\\nhis explanations, which were compounded of fag ends of miner’s talk\\nand superstition. He was a perfect gossip of the woods, this Pocket\\nHunter, and when I could get him away from “leads” and “strikes” and\\n“contacts,” full of fascinating small talk about the ebb and flood of\\ncreeks, the piñon crop on Black Mountain, and the wolves of Mesquite\\nValley. I suppose he never knew how much he depended for the necessary\\nsense of home and companionship on the beasts and trees, meeting and\\nfinding them in their wonted places,--the bear that used to come down\\nPine Creek in the spring, pawing out trout from the shelters of sod\\nbanks, the juniper at Lone Tree Spring, and the quail at Paddy Jack’s.\\n\\nThere is a place on Waban, south of White Mountain, where flat,\\nwind-tilted cedars make low tents and coves of shade and shelter,\\nwhere the wild sheep winter in the snow. Woodcutters and prospectors\\nhad brought me word of that, but the Pocket Hunter was accessory to\\nthe fact. About the opening of winter, when one looks for sudden big\\nstorms, he had attempted a crossing by the nearest path, beginning the\\nascent at noon. It grew cold, the snow came on thick and blinding, and\\nwiped out the trail in a white smudge; the storm drift blew in and cut\\noff landmarks, the early dark obscured the rising drifts. According to\\nthe Pocket Hunter’s account, he knew where he was, but couldn’t exactly\\nsay. Three days before he had been in the west arm of Death Valley on\\na short water allowance, ankle deep in shifty sand; now he was on the\\nrise of Waban, knee-deep in sodden snow, and in both cases he did the\\nonly allowable thing--he walked on. That is the only thing to do in a\\nsnowstorm in any case. It might have been the creature instinct, which\\nin his way of life had room to grow, that led him to the cedar shelter;\\nat any rate he found it about four hours after dark, and heard the\\nheavy breathing of the flock. He said that if he thought at all at this\\njuncture he must have thought that he had stumbled on a storm-belated\\nshepherd with his silly sheep; but in fact he took no note of anything\\nbut the warmth of packed fleeces, and snuggled in between them dead\\nwith sleep. If the flock stirred in the night he stirred drowsily to\\nkeep close and let the storm go by. That was all until morning woke him\\nshining on a white world. Then the very soul of him shook to see the\\nwild sheep of God stand up about him, nodding their great horns beneath\\nthe cedar roof, looking out on the wonder of the snow. They had moved a\\nlittle away from him with the coming of the light, but paid him no more\\nheed. The light broadened and the white pavilions of the snow swam in\\nthe heavenly blueness of the sea from which they rose. The cloud drift\\nscattered and broke billowing in the cañons. The leader stamped lightly\\non the litter to put the flock in motion, suddenly they took the drifts\\nin those long light leaps that are nearest to flight, down and away\\non the slopes of Waban. Think of that to happen to a Pocket Hunter!\\nBut though he had fallen on many a wished-for hap, he was curiously\\ninapt at getting the truth about beasts in general. He believed in\\nthe venom of toads, and charms for snake bites, and--for this I could\\nnever forgive him--had all the miner’s prejudices against my friend the\\ncoyote. Thief, sneak, and son of a thief were the friendliest words he\\nhad for this little gray dog of the wilderness.\\n\\nOf course with so much seeking he came occasionally upon pockets of\\nmore or less value, otherwise he could not have kept up his way of\\nlife; but he had as much luck in missing great ledges as in finding\\nsmall ones. He had been all over the Tonopah country, and brought away\\nfloat without happening upon anything that gave promise of what that\\ndistrict was to become in a few years. He claimed to have chipped\\nbits off the very outcrop of the California Rand, without finding it\\nworth while to bring away, but none of these things put him out of\\ncountenance.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt was once in roving weather, when we found him shifting pack on a\\nsteep trail, that I observed certain of his belongings done up in green\\ncanvas bags, the veritable “green bag” of English novels. It seemed\\nso incongruous a reminder in this untenanted West that I dropped\\ndown beside the trail overlooking the vast dim valley, to hear about\\nthe green canvas. He had gotten it, he said, in London years before,\\nand that was the first I had known of his having been abroad. It was\\nafter one of his “big strikes” that he had made the Grand Tour, and\\nhad brought nothing away from it but the green canvas bags, which he\\nconceived would fit his needs, and an ambition. This last was nothing\\nless than to strike it rich and set himself up among the eminently\\nbourgeois of London. It seemed that the situation of the wealthy\\nEnglish middle class, with just enough gentility above to aspire to,\\nand sufficient smaller fry to bully and patronize, appealed to his\\nimagination, though of course he did not put it so crudely as that.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt was no news to me then, two or three years after, to learn that he\\nhad taken ten thousand dollars from an abandoned claim, just the sort\\nof luck to have pleased him, and gone to London to spend it. The land\\nseemed not to miss him any more than it had minded him, but I missed\\nhim and could not forget the trick of expecting him in least likely\\nsituations. Therefore it was with a pricking sense of the familiar that\\nI followed a twilight trail of smoke, a year or two later, to the swale\\nof a dripping spring, and came upon a man by the fire with a coffee-pot\\nand frying-pan. I was not surprised to find it was the Pocket Hunter.\\nNo man can be stronger than his destiny.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHOSHONE LAND\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nIt is true I have been in Shoshone Land, but before that, long\\nbefore, I had seen it through the eyes of Winnenap´ in a rosy mist of\\nreminiscence, and must always see it with a sense of intimacy in the\\nlight that never was. Sitting on the golden slope at the campoodie,\\nlooking across the Bitter Lake to the purple tops of Mutarango, the\\nmedicine-man drew up its happy places one by one, like little blessed\\nislands in a sea of talk. For he was born a Shoshone, was Winnenap´;\\nand though his name, his wife, his children, and his tribal relations\\nwere of the Paiutes, his thoughts turned homesickly toward Shoshone\\nLand. Once a Shoshone always a Shoshone. Winnenap´ lived gingerly\\namong the Paiutes and in his heart despised them. But he could speak\\na tolerable English when he would, and he always would if it were of\\nShoshone Land.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nHe had come into the keeping of the Paiutes as a hostage for the long\\npeace which the authority of the whites made interminable, and, though\\nthere was now no order in the tribe, nor any power that could have\\nlawfully restrained him, kept on in the old usage, to save his honor\\nand the word of his vanished kin. He had seen his children’s children\\nin the borders of the Paiutes, but loved best his own miles of sand\\nand rainbow-painted hills. Professedly he had not seen them since the\\nbeginning of his hostage; but every year about the end of the rains and\\nbefore the strength of the sun had come upon us from the south, the\\nmedicine-man went apart on the mountains to gather herbs, and when he\\ncame again I knew by the new fortitude of his countenance and the new\\ncolor of his reminiscences that he had been alone and unspied upon in\\nShoshone Land.\\n\\nTo reach that country from the campoodie, one goes south and south,\\nwithin hearing of the lip-lip-lapping of the great tideless lake,\\nand south by east over a high rolling district, miles and miles of\\nsage and nothing else. So one comes to the country of the painted\\nhills,--old red cones of craters, wasteful beds of mineral earths, hot,\\nacrid springs, and steam jets issuing from a leprous soil. After the\\nhills the black rock, after the craters the spewed lava, ash strewn,\\nof incredible thickness, and full of sharp, winding rifts. There are\\npicture writings carved deep in the face of the cliffs to mark the way\\nfor those who do not know it. On the very edge of the black rock the\\nearth falls away in a wide sweeping hollow, which is Shoshone Land.\\n\\nSouth the land rises in very blue hills, blue because thickly wooded\\nwith ceanothus and manzanita, the haunt of deer and the border of the\\nShoshones. Eastward the land goes very far by broken ranges, narrow\\nvalleys of pure desertness, and huge mesas uplifted to the sky-line,\\neast and east, and no man knows the end of it.\\n\\nIt is the country of the bighorn, the wapiti, and the wolf, nesting\\nplace of buzzards, land of cloud-nourished trees and wild things that\\nlive without drink. Above all, it is the land of the creosote and the\\nmesquite. The mesquite is God’s best thought in all this desertness. It\\ngrows in the open, is thorny, stocky, close grown, and iron-rooted.\\nLong winds move in the draughty valleys, blown sand fills and fills\\nabout the lower branches, piling pyramidal dunes, from the top of which\\nthe mesquite twigs flourish greenly. Fifteen or twenty feet under the\\ndrift, where it seems no rain could penetrate, the main trunk grows,\\nattaining often a yard’s thickness, resistant as oak. In Shoshone Land\\none digs for large timber; that is in the southerly, sandy exposures.\\nHigher on the table-topped ranges low trees of juniper and piñon stand\\neach apart, rounded and spreading heaps of greenness. Between them, but\\neach to itself in smooth clear spaces, tufts of tall feathered grass.\\n\\nThis is the sense of the desert hills, that there is room enough and\\ntime enough. Trees grow to consummate domes; every plant has its\\nperfect work. Noxious weeds such as come up thickly in crowded fields\\ndo not flourish in the free spaces. Live long enough with an Indian,\\nand he or the wild things will show you a use for everything that grows\\nin these borders.\\n\\nThe manner of the country makes the usage of life there, and the land\\nwill not be lived in except in its own fashion. The Shoshones live\\nlike their trees, with great spaces between, and in pairs and in\\nfamily groups they set up wattled huts by the infrequent springs. More\\nwickiups than two make a very great number. Their shelters are lightly\\nbuilt, for they travel much and far, following where deer feed and\\nseeds ripen, but they are not more lonely than other creatures that\\ninhabit there.\\n\\nThe year’s round is somewhat in this fashion. After the piñon\\nharvest the clans foregather on a warm southward slope for the\\nannual adjustment of tribal difficulties and the medicine dance, for\\nmarriage and mourning and vengeance, and the exchange of serviceable\\ninformation; if, for example, the deer have shifted their feeding\\nground, if the wild sheep have come back to Waban, or certain springs\\nrun full or dry. Here the Shoshones winter flockwise, weaving baskets\\nand hunting big game driven down from the country of the deep snow.\\nAnd this brief intercourse is all the use they have of their kind, for\\nnow there are no wars, and many of their ancient crafts have fallen\\ninto disuse. The solitariness of the life breeds in the men, as in the\\nplants, a certain well-roundedness and sufficiency to its own ends.\\nAny Shoshone family has in itself the man-seed, power to multiply\\nand replenish, potentialities for food and clothing and shelter, for\\nhealing and beautifying.\\n\\nWhen the rain is over and gone they are stirred by the instinct of\\nthose that journeyed eastward from Eden, and go up each with his mate\\nand young brood, like birds to old nesting places. The beginning of\\nspring in Shoshone Land--oh the soft wonder of it!--is a mistiness\\nas of incense smoke, a veil of greenness over the whitish stubby\\nshrubs, a web of color on the silver sanded soil. No counting covers\\nthe multitude of rayed blossoms that break suddenly underfoot in the\\nbrief season of the winter rains, with silky furred or prickly viscid\\nfoliage, or no foliage at all. They are morning and evening bloomers\\nchiefly, and strong seeders. Years of scant rains they lie shut and\\nsafe in the winnowed sands, so that some species appear to be extinct.\\nYears of long storms they break so thickly into bloom that no horse\\ntreads without crushing them. These years the gullies of the hills are\\nrank with fern and a great tangle of climbing vines.\\n\\nJust as the mesa twilights have their vocal note in the love call of\\nthe burrowing owl, so the desert spring is voiced by the mourning\\ndoves. Welcome and sweet they sound in the smoky mornings before\\nbreeding time, and where they frequent in any great numbers water is\\nconfidently looked for. Still by the springs one finds the cunning\\nbrush shelters from which the Shoshones shot arrows at them when the\\ndoves came to drink.\\n\\nNow as to these same Shoshones there are some who claim that they\\nhave no right to the name, which belongs to a more northerly tribe;\\nbut that is the word they will be called by, and there is no greater\\noffense than to call an Indian out of his name. According to their\\ntraditions and all proper evidence, they were a great people occupying\\nfar north and east of their present bounds, driven thence by the\\nPaiutes. Between the two tribes is the residuum of old hostilities.\\n\\nWinnenap´, whose memory ran to the time when the boundary of the Paiute\\ncountry was a dead-line to Shoshones, told me once how himself and\\nanother lad, in an unforgotten spring, discovered a nesting place of\\nbuzzards a bit of a way beyond the borders. And they two burned to\\nrob those nests. Oh, for no purpose at all except as boys rob nests\\nimmemorially, for the fun of it, to have and handle and show to other\\nlads as an exceeding treasure, and afterwards discard. So, not quite\\nmeaning to, but breathless with daring, they crept up a gully, across\\na sage brush flat and through a waste of boulders, to the rugged pines\\nwhere their sharp eyes had made out the buzzards settling.\\n\\nThe medicine-man told me, always with a quaking relish at this point,\\nthat while they, grown bold by success, were still in the tree, they\\nsighted a Paiute hunting party crossing between them and their own\\nland. That was mid-morning, and all day on into the dark the boys crept\\nand crawled and slid, from boulder to bush, and bush to boulder, in\\ncactus scrub and on naked sand, always in a sweat of fear, until the\\ndust caked in the nostrils and the breath sobbed in the body, around\\nand away many a mile until they came to their own land again. And all\\nthe time Winnenap´ carried those buzzard’s eggs in the slack of his\\nsingle buckskin garment! Young Shoshones are like young quail, knowing\\nwithout teaching about feeding and hiding, and learning what civilized\\nchildren never learn, to be still and to keep on being still, at the\\nfirst hint of danger or strangeness.\\n\\nAs for food, that appears to be chiefly a matter of being willing.\\nDesert Indians all eat chuck-wallas, big black and white lizards that\\nhave delicate white flesh savored like chicken. Both the Shoshones and\\nthe coyotes are fond of the flesh of _Gopherus agassizii_, the turtle\\nthat by feeding on buds, going without drink, and burrowing in the sand\\nthrough the winter, contrives to live a known period of twenty-five\\nyears. It seems that most seeds are foodful in the arid regions, most\\nberries edible, and many shrubs good for firewood with the sap in\\nthem. The mesquite bean, whether the screw or straight pod, pounded to\\na meal, boiled to a kind of mush, and dried in cakes, sulphur-colored\\nand needing an axe to cut it, is an excellent food for long journeys.\\nFermented in water with wild honey and the honeycomb, it makes a\\npleasant, mildly intoxicating drink.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nNext to spring, the best time to visit Shoshone Land is when the\\ndeer-star hangs low and white like a torch over the morning hills. Go\\nup past Winnedumah and down Saline and up again to the rim of Mesquite\\nValley. Take no tent, but if you will, have an Indian build you a\\nwickiup, willows planted in a circle, drawn over to an arch, and bound\\ncunningly with withes, all the leaves on, and chinks to count the stars\\nthrough. But there was never any but Winnenap´ who could tell and make\\nit worth telling about Shoshone Land.\\n\\nAnd Winnenap´ will not any more. He died, as do most medicine-men of\\nthe Paiutes.\\n\\nWhere the lot falls when the campoodie chooses a medicine-man there\\nit rests. It is an honor a man seldom seeks but must wear, an honor\\nwith a condition. When three patients die under his ministrations, the\\nmedicine-man must yield his life and his office. Wounds do not count;\\nbroken bones and bullet holes the Indian can understand, but measles,\\npneumonia, and smallpox are witchcraft. Winnenap´ was medicine-man for\\nfifteen years. Besides considerable skill in healing herbs, he used his\\nprerogatives cunningly. It is permitted the medicine-man to decline the\\ncase when the patient has had treatment from any other, say the white\\ndoctor, whom many of the younger generation consult. Or, if before\\nhaving seen the patient, he can definitely refer his disorder to some\\nsupernatural cause wholly out of the medicine-man’s jurisdiction, say\\nto the spite of an evil spirit going about in the form of a coyote,\\nand states the case convincingly, he may avoid the penalty. But this\\nmust not be pushed too far. All else failing, he can hide. Winnenap´\\ndid this the time of the measles epidemic. Returning from his yearly\\nherb gathering, he heard of it at Black Rock, and turning aside, he was\\nnot to be found, nor did he return to his own place until the disease\\nhad spent itself, and half the children of the campoodie were in their\\nshallow graves with beads sprinkled over them.\\n\\nIt is possible the tale of Winnenap´’s patients had not been strictly\\nkept. There had not been a medicine-man killed in the valley for twelve\\nyears, and for that the perpetrators had been severely punished by the\\nwhites. The winter of the Big Snow an epidemic of pneumonia carried off\\nthe Indians with scarcely a warning; from the lake northward to the\\nlava flats they died in the sweat-houses, and under the hands of the\\nmedicine-men. Even the drugs of the white physician had no power.\\n\\n[Illustration: ARRIVAL OF THE EXECUTIONERS]\\n\\nAfter two weeks of this plague the Paiutes drew to council to consider\\nthe remissness of their medicine-men. They were sore with grief and\\nafraid for themselves; as a result of the council, one in every\\ncampoodie was sentenced to the ancient penalty. But schooling and\\nnative shrewdness had raised up in the younger men an unfaith in old\\nusages, so judgment halted between sentence and execution. At Three\\nPines the government teacher brought out influential whites to threaten\\nand cajole the stubborn tribes. At Tunawai the conservatives sent into\\nNevada for that pacific old humbug, Johnson Sides, most notable of\\nPaiute orators, to harangue his people. Citizens of the towns turned\\nout with food and comforts, and so after a season the trouble passed.\\n\\nBut here at Maverick there was no school, no oratory, and no\\nalleviation. One third of the campoodie died, and the rest killed\\nthe medicine-men. Winnenap´ expected it, and for days walked and sat\\na little apart from his family that he might meet it as became a\\nShoshone, no doubt suffering the agony of dread deferred. When finally\\nthree men came and sat at his fire without greeting he knew his time.\\nHe turned a little from them, dropped his chin upon his knees, and\\nlooked out over Shoshone Land, breathing evenly. The women went into\\nthe wickiup and covered their heads with their blankets.\\n\\nSo much has the Indian lost of savageness by merely desisting from\\nkilling, that the executioners braved themselves to their work\\nby drinking and a show of quarrelsomeness. In the end a sharp\\nhatchet-stroke discharged the duty of the campoodie. Afterward his\\nwomen buried him, and a warm wind coming out of the south, the force of\\nthe disease was broken, and even they acquiesced in the wisdom of the\\ntribe. That summer they told me all except the names of the Three.\\n\\nSince it appears that we make our own heaven here, no doubt we shall\\nhave a hand in the heaven of hereafter; and I know what Winnenap´’s\\nwill be like: worth going to if one has leave to live in it according\\nto his liking. It will be tawny gold underfoot, walled up with jacinth\\nand jasper, ribbed with chalcedony, and yet no hymn-book heaven, but\\nthe free air and free spaces of Shoshone Land.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJIMVILLE\\n\\nA BRET HARTE TOWN\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nWhen Mr. Harte found himself with a fresh palette and his particular\\nlocal color fading from the West, he did what he considered the only\\nsafe thing, and carried his young impression away to be worked out\\nuntroubled by any newer fact. He should have gone to Jimville. There he\\nwould have found cast up on the ore-ribbed hills the bleached timbers\\nof more tales, and better ones.\\n\\nYou could not think of Jimville as anything more than a survival, like\\nthe herb-eating, bony-cased old tortoise that pokes cheerfully about\\nthose borders some thousands of years beyond his proper epoch. Not\\nthat Jimville is old, but it has an atmosphere favorable to the type of\\na half century back, if not “forty-niners,” of that breed. It is said\\nof Jimville that getting away from it is such a piece of work that it\\nencourages permanence in the population; the fact is that most have\\nbeen drawn there by some real likeness or liking. Not however that\\nI would deny the difficulty of getting into or out of that cove of\\nreminder, I who have made the journey so many times at great pains of\\na poor body. Any way you go at it, Jimville is about three days from\\nanywhere in particular. North or south, after the railroad there is a\\nstage journey of such interminable monotony as induces forgetfulness of\\nall previous states of existence.\\n\\nThe road to Jimville is the happy hunting ground of old stage-coaches\\nbought up from superseded routes the West over, rocking, lumbering,\\nwide vehicles far gone in the odor of romance, coaches that Vasquez has\\nheld up, from whose high seats express messengers have shot or been\\nshot as their luck held. This is to comfort you when the driver stops\\nto rummage for wire to mend a failing bolt. There is enough of this\\nsort of thing to quite prepare you to believe what the driver insists,\\nnamely, that all that country and Jimville are held together by wire.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nFirst on the way to Jimville you cross a lonely open land, with a hint\\nin the sky of things going on under the horizon, a palpitant, white,\\nhot land where the wheels gird at the sand and the midday heaven shuts\\nit in breathlessly like a tent. So in still weather; and when the\\nwind blows there is occupation enough for the passengers, shifting\\nseats to hold down the windward side of the wagging coach. This is\\na mere trifle. The Jimville stage is built for five passengers, but\\nwhen you have seven, with four trunks, several parcels, three sacks\\nof grain, the mail and express, you begin to understand that proverb\\nabout the road which has been reported to you. In time you learn to\\nengage the high seat beside the driver, where you get good air and the\\nbest company. Beyond the desert rise the lava flats, scoriæ strewn;\\nsharp-cutting walls of narrow cañons; league-wide, frozen puddles of\\nblack rock, intolerable and forbidding. Beyond the lava the mouths\\nthat spewed it out, ragged-lipped, ruined craters shouldering to the\\ncloud-line, mostly of red earth, as red as a red heifer. These have\\nsome comforting of shrubs and grass. You get the very spirit of the\\nmeaning of that country when you see Little Pete feeding his sheep\\nin the red, choked maw of an old vent,--a kind of silly pastoral\\ngentleness that glozes over an elemental violence. Beyond the craters\\nrise worn, auriferous hills of a quiet sort, tumbled together; a valley\\nfull of mists; whitish green scrub; and bright, small, panting lizards;\\nthen Jimville.\\n\\nThe town looks to have spilled out of Squaw Gulch, and that, in fact,\\nis the sequence of its growth. It began around the Bully Boy and\\nTheresa group of mines midway up Squaw Gulch, spreading down to the\\nsmelter at the mouth of the ravine. The freight wagons dumped their\\nloads as near to the mill as the slope allowed, and Jimville grew\\nin between. Above the Gulch begins a pine wood with sparsely grown\\nthickets of lilac, azalea, and odorous blossoming shrubs.\\n\\nSquaw Gulch is a very sharp, steep, ragged-walled ravine, and that\\npart of Jimville which is built in it has only one street,--in summer\\npaved with bone-white cobbles, in the wet months a frothy yellow flood.\\nAll between the ore dumps and solitary small cabins, pieced out with\\ntin cans and packing cases, run footpaths drawing down to the Silver\\nDollar saloon. When Jimville was having the time of its life the Silver\\nDollar had those same coins let into the bar top for a border, but the\\nproprietor pried them out when the glory departed. There are three\\nhundred inhabitants in Jimville and four bars, though you are not to\\nargue anything from that.\\n\\nHear now how Jimville came by its name. Jim Calkins discovered the\\nBully Boy, Jim Baker located the Theresa. When Jim Jenkins opened an\\neating-house in his tent he chalked up on the flap, “Best meals in\\nJimville, $1.00,” and the name stuck.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThere was more human interest in the origin of Squaw Gulch, though it\\ntickled no humor. It was Dimmick’s squaw from Aurora way. If Dimmick\\nhad been anything except New Englander he would have called her a\\nmahala, but that would not have bettered his behavior. Dimmick made a\\nstrike, went East, and the squaw who had been to him as his wife took\\nto drink. That was the bald way of stating it in the Aurora country.\\nThe milk of human kindness, like some wine, must not be uncorked too\\nmuch in speech lest it lose savor. This is what they did. The woman\\nwould have returned to her own people, being far gone with child,\\nbut the drink worked her bane. By the river of this ravine her pains\\novertook her. There Jim Calkins, prospecting, found her dying with a\\nthree days’ babe nozzling at her breast. Jim heartened her for the\\nend, buried her, and walked back to Poso, eighteen miles, the child\\npoking in the folds of his denim shirt with small mewing noises, and\\nwon support for it from the rough-handed folks of that place. Then he\\ncame back to Squaw Gulch, so named from that day, and discovered the\\nBully Boy. Jim humbly regarded this piece of luck as interposed for his\\nreward, and I for one believed him. If it had been in mediæval times\\nyou would have had a legend or a ballad. Bret Harte would have given\\nyou a tale. You see in me a mere recorder, for I know what is best for\\nyou; you shall blow out this bubble from your own breath.\\n\\nYou could never get into any proper relation to Jimville unless you\\ncould slough off and swallow your acquired prejudices as a lizard\\ndoes his skin. Once wanting some womanly attentions, the stage-driver\\nassured me I might have them at the Nine-Mile House from the lady\\nbarkeeper. The phrase tickled all my after-dinner-coffee sense of humor\\ninto an anticipation of Poker Flat. The stage-driver proved himself\\nreally right, though you are not to suppose from this that Jimville had\\nno conventions and no caste. They work out these things in the personal\\nequation largely. Almost every latitude of behavior is allowed a good\\nfellow, one no liar, a free spender, and a backer of his friends’\\nquarrels. You are respected in as much ground as you can shoot over,\\nin as many pretensions as you can make good.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThat probably explains Mr. Fanshawe, the gentlemanly faro dealer of\\nthose parts, built for the rôle of Oakhurst, going white-shirted and\\nfrock-coated in a community of overalls; and persuading you that\\nwhatever shifts and tricks of the game were laid to his deal, he\\ncould not practice them on a person of your penetration. But he does.\\nBy his own account and the evidence of his manners he had been bred\\nfor a clergyman, and he certainly has gifts for the part. You find\\nhim always in possession of your point of view, and with an evident\\nthough not obtrusive desire to stand well with you. For an account of\\nhis killings, for his way with women and the way of women with him, I\\nrefer you to Brown of Calaveras and some others of that stripe. His\\nimproprieties had a certain sanction of long standing not accorded to\\nthe gay ladies who wore Mr. Fanshawe’s favors. There were perhaps too\\nmany of them. On the whole, the point of the moral distinctions of\\nJimville appears to be a point of honor, with an absence of humorous\\nappreciation that strangers mistake for dullness. At Jimville they see\\nbehavior as history and judge it by facts, untroubled by invention and\\nthe dramatic sense. You glimpse a crude equity in their dealings with\\nWilkins, who had shot a man at Lone Tree, fairly, in an open quarrel.\\nRumor of it reached Jimville before Wilkins rested there in flight. I\\nsaw Wilkins, all Jimville saw him; in fact, he came into the Silver\\nDollar when we were holding a church fair and bought a pink silk\\npincushion. I have often wondered what became of it. Some of us shook\\nhands with him, not because we did not know, but because we had not\\nbeen officially notified, and there were those present who knew how\\nit was themselves. When the sheriff arrived Wilkins had moved on, and\\nJimville organized a posse and brought him back, because the sheriff\\nwas a Jimville man and we had to stand by him.\\n\\nI said we had the church fair at the Silver Dollar. We had most things\\nthere, dances, town meetings, and the kinetoscope exhibition of the\\nPassion Play. The Silver Dollar had been built when the borders of\\nJimville spread from Minton to the red hill the Defiance twisted\\nthrough. “Side-Winder” Smith scrubbed the floor for us and moved the\\nbar to the back room. The fair was designed for the support of the\\ncircuit rider who preached to the few that would hear, and buried us\\nall in turn. He was the symbol of Jimville’s respectability, although\\nhe was of a sect that held dancing among the cardinal sins. The\\nmanagement took no chances on offending the minister; at 11.30 they\\ntendered him the receipts of the evening in the chairman’s hat, as a\\ndelicate intimation that the fair was closed. The company filed out of\\nthe front door and around to the back. Then the dance began formally\\nwith no feelings hurt. These were the sort of courtesies, common enough\\nin Jimville, that brought tears of delicate inner laughter.\\n\\nThere were others besides Mr. Fanshawe who had walked out of Mr.\\nHarte’s demesne to Jimville and wore names that smacked of the\\nsoil,--“Alkali Bill,” “Pike” Wilson, “Three Finger,” and “Mono Jim;”\\nfierce, shy, profane, sun-dried derelicts of the windy hills, who each\\nowned, or had owned, a mine and was wishful to own one again. They\\nlaid up on the worn benches of the Silver Dollar or the Same Old Luck\\nlike beached vessels, and their talk ran on endlessly of “strike” and\\n“contact” and “mother lode,” and worked around to fights and hold-ups,\\nvillainy, haunts, and the hoodoo of the Minietta, told austerely\\nwithout imagination.\\n\\nDo not suppose I am going to repeat it all; you who want these things\\nwritten up from the point of view of people who do not do them every\\nday would get no savor in their speech.\\n\\nSays Three Finger, relating the history of the Mariposa, “I took it\\noff’n Tom Beatty, cheap, after his brother Bill was shot.”\\n\\nSays Jim Jenkins, “What was the matter of him?”\\n\\n“Who? Bill? Abe Johnson shot him; he was fooling around Johnson’s wife,\\nan’ Tom sold me the mine dirt cheap.”\\n\\n“Why didn’t he work it himself?”\\n\\n“Him? Oh, he was laying for Abe and calculated to have to leave the\\ncountry pretty quick.”\\n\\n“Huh!” says Jim Jenkins, and the tale flows smoothly on.\\n\\nYearly the spring fret floats the loose population of Jimville out\\ninto the desolate waste hot lands, guiding by the peaks and a few\\nrarely touched water-holes, always, always with the golden hope. They\\ndevelop prospects and grow rich, develop others and grow poor but\\nnever embittered. Say the hills, It is all one, there is gold enough,\\ntime enough, and men enough to come after you. And at Jimville they\\nunderstand the language of the hills.\\n\\nJimville does not know a great deal about the crust of the earth, it\\nprefers a “hunch.” That is an intimation from the gods that if you go\\nover a brown back of the hills, by a dripping spring, up Coso way, you\\nwill find what is worth while. I have never heard that the failure of\\nany particular hunch disproved the principle. Somehow the rawness of\\nthe land favors the sense of personal relation to the supernatural.\\nThere is not much intervention of crops, cities, clothes, and manners\\nbetween you and the organizing forces to cut off communication. All\\nthis begets in Jimville a state that passes explanation unless you\\nwill accept an explanation that passes belief. Along with killing\\nand drunkenness, coveting of women, charity, simplicity, there is\\na certain indifference, blankness, emptiness if you will, of all\\nvaporings, no bubbling of the pot,--it wants the German to coin a word\\nfor that,--no bread-envy, no brother-fervor. Western writers have not\\nsensed it yet; they smack the savor of lawlessness too much upon their\\ntongues, but you have these to witness it is not mean-spiritedness. It\\nis pure Greek in that it represents the courage to sheer off what is\\nnot worth while. Beyond that it endures without sniveling, renounces\\nwithout self-pity, fears no death, rates itself not too great in the\\nscheme of things; so do beasts, so did St. Jerome in the desert, so\\nalso in the elder day did gods. Life, its performance, cessation, is no\\nnew thing to gape and wonder at.\\n\\nHere you have the repose of the perfectly accepted instinct which\\nincludes passion and death in its perquisites. I suppose that the end\\nof all our hammering and yawping will be something like the point of\\nview of Jimville. The only difference will be in the decorations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMY NEIGHBOR’S FIELD\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nIt is one of those places God must have meant for a field from all\\ntime, lying very level at the foot of the slope that crowds up against\\nKearsarge, falling slightly toward the town. North and south it is\\nfenced by low old glacial ridges, boulder strewn and untenable.\\nEastward it butts on orchard closes and the village gardens, brimming\\nover into them by wild brier and creeping grass. The village street,\\nwith its double row of unlike houses, breaks off abruptly at the edge\\nof the field in a footpath that goes up the streamside, beyond it, to\\nthe source of waters.\\n\\nThe field is not greatly esteemed of the town, not being put to the\\nplough nor affording firewood, but breeding all manner of wild seeds\\nthat go down in the irrigating ditches to come up as weeds in the\\ngardens and grass plots. But when I had no more than seen it in the\\ncharm of its spring smiling, I knew I should have no peace until I had\\nbought ground and built me a house beside it, with a little wicket to\\ngo in and out at all hours, as afterward came about.\\n\\nEdswick, Roeder, Connor, and Ruffin owned the field before it fell to\\nmy neighbor. But before that the Paiutes, mesne lords of the soil, made\\na campoodie by the rill of Pine Creek; and after, contesting the soil\\nwith them, cattle-men, who found its foodful pastures greatly to their\\nadvantage; and bands of blethering flocks shepherded by wild, hairy\\nmen of little speech, who attested their rights to the feeding ground\\nwith their long staves upon each other’s skulls. Edswick homesteaded\\nthe field about the time the wild tide of mining life was roaring and\\nrioting up Kearsarge, and where the village now stands built a stone\\nhut, with loopholes to make good his claim against cattle-men or\\nIndians. But Edswick died and Roeder became master of the field. Roeder\\nowned cattle on a thousand hills, and made it a recruiting ground for\\nhis bellowing herds before beginning the long drive to market across a\\nshifty desert. He kept the field fifteen years, and afterward falling\\ninto difficulties, put it out as security against certain sums. Connor,\\nwho held the securities, was cleverer than Roeder and not so busy. The\\nmoney fell due the winter of the Big Snow, when all the trails were\\nforty feet under drifts, and Roeder was away in San Francisco selling\\nhis cattle. At the set time Connor took the law by the forelock and\\nwas adjudged possession of the field. Eighteen days later Roeder\\narrived on snowshoes, both feet frozen, and the money in his pack. In\\nthe long suit at law ensuing, the field fell to Ruffin, that clever\\none-armed lawyer with the tongue to wile a bird out of the bush,\\nConnor’s counsel, and was sold by him to my neighbor, whom from envying\\nhis possession I call Naboth.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nCuriously, all this human occupancy of greed and mischief left no mark\\non the field, but the Indians did, and the unthinking sheep. Round its\\ncorners children pick up chipped arrow points of obsidian, scattered\\nthrough it are kitchen middens and pits of old sweat-houses. By the\\nsouth corner, where the campoodie stood, is a single shrub of “hoopee”\\n(_Lycium Andersonii_), maintaining itself hardly among alien shrubs,\\nand near by, three low rakish trees of hackberry, so far from home that\\nno prying of mine has been able to find another in any cañon east or\\nwest. But the berries of both were food for the Paiutes, eagerly sought\\nand traded for as far south as Shoshone Land. By the fork of the creek\\nwhere the shepherds camp is a single clump of mesquite of the variety\\ncalled “screw bean.” The seed must have shaken there from some sheep’s\\ncoat, for this is not the habitat of mesquite, and except for other\\nsingle shrubs at sheep camps, none grows freely for a hundred and fifty\\nmiles south or east.\\n\\nNaboth has put a fence about the best of the field, but neither the\\nIndians nor the shepherds can quite forego it. They make camp and build\\ntheir wattled huts about the borders of it, and no doubt they have\\nsome sense of home in its familiar aspect.\\n\\nAs I have said, it is a low-lying field, between the mesa and the town,\\nwith no hillocks in it, but a gentle swale where the waste water of the\\ncreek goes down to certain farms, and the hackberry-trees, of which\\nthe tallest might be three times the height of a man, are the tallest\\nthings in it. A mile up from the water gate that turns the creek into\\nsupply pipes for the town, begins a row of long-leaved pines, threading\\nthe watercourse to the foot of Kearsarge. These are the pines that\\npuzzle the local botanist, not easily determined, and unrelated to\\nother conifers of the Sierra slope; the same pines of which the Indians\\nrelate a legend mixed of brotherliness and the retribution of God.\\nOnce the pines possessed the field, as the worn stumps of them along\\nthe streamside show, and it would seem their secret purpose to regain\\ntheir old footing. Now and then some seedling escapes the devastating\\nsheep a rod or two down-stream. Since I came to live by the field\\none of these has tiptoed above the gully of the creek, beckoning the\\nprocession from the hills, as if in fact they would make back toward\\nthat skyward-pointing finger of granite on the opposite range, from\\nwhich, according to the legend, when they were bad Indians and it a\\ngreat chief, they ran away. This year the summer floods brought the\\nround, brown, fruitful cones to my very door, and I look, if I live\\nlong enough, to see them come up greenly in my neighbor’s field.\\n\\nIt is interesting to watch this retaking of old ground by the wild\\nplants, banished by human use. Since Naboth drew his fence about the\\nfield and restricted it to a few wild-eyed steers, halting between the\\nhills and the shambles, many old habitués of the field have come back\\nto their haunts. The willow and brown birch, long ago cut off by the\\nIndians for wattles, have come back to the streamside, slender and\\nvirginal in their spring greenness, and leaving long stretches of the\\nbrown water open to the sky. In stony places where no grass grows,\\nwild olives sprawl; close-twigged, blue-gray patches in winter, more\\ntranslucent greenish gold in spring than any aureole. Along with willow\\nand birch and brier, the clematis, that shyest plant of water borders,\\nslips down season by season to within a hundred yards of the village\\nstreet. Convinced after three years that it would come no nearer, we\\nspent time fruitlessly pulling up roots to plant in the garden. All\\nthis while, when no coaxing or care prevailed upon any transplanted\\nslip to grow, one was coming up silently outside the fence near the\\nwicket, coiling so secretly in the rabbit-brush that its presence was\\nnever suspected until it flowered delicately along its twining length.\\nThe horehound comes through the fence and under it, shouldering the\\npickets off the railings; the brier rose mines under the horehound;\\nand no care, though I own I am not a close weeder, keeps the small\\npale moons of the primrose from rising to the night moth under my\\napple-trees. The first summer in the new place, a clump of cypripediums\\ncame up by the irrigating ditch at the bottom of the lawn. But the\\nclematis will not come inside, nor the wild almond.\\n\\nI have forgotten to find out, though I meant to, whether the wild\\nalmond grew in that country where Moses kept the flocks of his\\nfather-in-law, but if so one can account for the burning bush. It\\ncomes upon one with a flame-burst as of revelation; little hard red\\nbuds on leafless twigs, swelling unnoticeably, then one, two, or three\\nstrong suns, and from tip to tip one soft fiery glow, whispering with\\nbees as a singing flame. A twig of finger size will be furred to the\\nthickness of one’s wrist by pink five-petaled bloom, so close that\\nonly the blunt-faced wild bees find their way in it. In this latitude\\nlate frosts cut off the hope of fruit too often for the wild almond to\\nmultiply greatly, but the spiny, tap-rooted shrubs are resistant to\\nmost plant evils.\\n\\nIt is not easy always to be attentive to the maturing of wild fruit.\\nPlants are so unobtrusive in their material processes, and always at\\nthe significant moment some other bloom has reached its perfect hour.\\nOne can never fix the precise moment when the rosy tint the field has\\nfrom the wild almond passes into the inspiring blue of lupines. One\\nnotices here and there a spike of bloom, and a day later the whole\\nfield royal and ruffling lightly to the wind. Part of the charm of\\nthe lupine is the continual stir of its plumes to airs not suspected\\notherwhere. Go and stand by any crown of bloom and the tall stalks do\\nbut rock a little as for drowsiness, but look off across the field,\\nand on the stillest days there is always a trepidation in the purple\\npatches.\\n\\nFrom midsummer until frost the prevailing note of the field is\\nclear gold, passing into the rusty tone of bigelovia going into a\\ndecline, a succession of color schemes more admirably managed than the\\ntransformation scene at the theatre. Under my window a colony of cleome\\nmade a soft web of bloom that drew me every morning for a long still\\ntime; and one day I discovered that I was looking into a rare fretwork\\nof fawn and straw colored twigs from which both bloom and leaf had\\ngone, and I could not say if it had been for a matter of weeks or days.\\nThe time to plant cucumbers and set out cabbages may be set down in the\\nalmanac, but never seed-time nor blossom in Naboth’s field.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nCertain winged and mailed denizens of the field seem to reach their\\nheyday along with the plants they most affect. In June the leaning\\ntowers of the white milkweed are jeweled over with red and gold\\nbeetles, climbing dizzily. This is that milkweed from whose stems\\nthe Indians flayed fibre to make snares for small game, but what\\nuse the beetles put it to except for a displaying ground for their\\ngay coats, I could never discover. The white butterfly crop comes\\non with the bigelovia bloom, and on warm mornings makes an airy\\ntwinkling all across the field. In September young linnets grow out\\nof the rabbit-brush in the night. All the nests discoverable in\\nthe neighboring orchards will not account for the numbers of them.\\nSomewhere, by the same secret process by which the field matures a\\nmillion more seeds than it needs, it is maturing red-hooded linnets\\nfor their devouring. All the purlieus of bigelovia and artemisia are\\nnoisy with them for a month. Suddenly as they come as suddenly go the\\nfly-by-nights, that pitch and toss on dusky barred wings above the\\nfield of summer twilights. Never one of these nighthawks will you see\\nafter linnet time, though the hurtle of their wings makes a pleasant\\nsound across the dusk in their season.\\n\\nFor two summers a great red-tailed hawk has visited the field every\\nafternoon between three and four o’clock, swooping and soaring with\\nthe airs of a gentleman adventurer. What he finds there is chiefly\\nconjectured, so secretive are the little people of Naboth’s field. Only\\nwhen leaves fall and the light is low and slant, one sees the long\\nclean flanks of the jackrabbits, leaping like small deer, and of late\\nafternoons little cotton-tails scamper in the runways. But the most\\none sees of the burrowers, gophers, and mice is the fresh earthwork of\\ntheir newly opened doors, or the pitiful small shreds the butcher-bird\\nhangs on spiny shrubs.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt is a still field, this of my neighbor’s, though so busy, and\\nadmirably compounded for variety and pleasantness,--a little sand, a\\nlittle loam, a grassy plot, a stony rise or two, a full brown stream,\\na little touch of humanness, a footpath trodden out by moccasins.\\nNaboth expects to make town lots of it and his fortune in one and the\\nsame day; but when I take the trail to talk with old Seyavi at the\\ncampoodie, it occurs to me that though the field may serve a good turn\\nin those days it will hardly be happier. No, certainly not happier.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MESA TRAIL\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nThe mesa trail begins in the campoodie at the corner of Naboth’s field,\\nthough one may drop into it from the wood road toward the cañon, or\\nfrom any of the cattle paths that go up along the streamside; a clean,\\npale, smooth-trodden way between spiny shrubs, comfortably wide for a\\nhorse or an Indian. It begins, I say, at the campoodie, and goes on\\ntoward the twilight hills and the borders of Shoshone Land. It strikes\\ndiagonally across the foot of the hill-slope from the field until\\nit reaches the larkspur level, and holds south along the front of\\nOppapago, having the high ranges to the right and the foothills and the\\ngreat Bitter Lake below it on the left. The mesa holds very level here,\\ncut across at intervals by the deep washes of dwindling streams, and\\nits treeless spaces uncramp the soul.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMesa trails were meant to be traveled on horseback, at the jigging\\ncoyote trot that only western-bred horses learn successfully. A\\nfoot-pace carries one too slowly past the units in a decorative scheme\\nthat is on a scale with the country round for bigness. It takes days’\\njourneys to give a note of variety to the country of the social\\nshrubs. These chiefly clothe the benches and eastern foot-slopes of\\nthe Sierras,--great spreads of artemisia, _coleogyne_, and spinosa,\\nsuffering no other woody stemmed thing in their purlieus; this by\\nelection apparently, with no elbowing; and the several shrubs have each\\ntheir clientèle of flowering herbs. It would be worth knowing how much\\nthe devastating sheep have had to do with driving the tender plants\\nto the shelter of the prickle bushes. It might have begun earlier, in\\nthe time Seyavi of the campoodie tells of, when antelope ran on the\\nmesa like sheep for numbers, but scarcely any foot-high herb rears\\nitself except from the midst of some stout twigged shrub; larkspur in\\nthe _coleogyne_, and for every spinosa the purpling coils of phacelia.\\nIn the shrub shelter, in the season, flock the little stemless things\\nwhose blossom time is as short as a marriage song. The larkspurs make\\nthe best showing, being tall and sweet, swaying a little above the\\nshrubbery, scattering pollen dust which Navajo brides gather to fill\\ntheir marriage baskets. This were an easier task than to find two of\\nthem of a shade. Larkspurs in the botany are blue, but if you were to\\nslip rein to the stub of some black sage and set about proving it\\nyou would be still at it by the hour when the white gilias set their\\npale disks to the westering sun. This is the gilia the children call\\n“evening snow,” and it is no use trying to improve on children’s names\\nfor wild flowers.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nFrom the height of a horse you look down to clean spaces in a shifty\\nyellow soil, bare to the eye as a newly sanded floor. Then as soon as\\never the hill shadows begin to swell out from the sidelong ranges, come\\nlittle flakes of whiteness fluttering at the edge of the sand. By dusk\\nthere are tiny drifts in the lee of every strong shrub, rosy-tipped\\ncorollas as riotous in the sliding mesa wind as if they were real\\nflakes shaken out of a cloud, not sprung from the ground on wiry\\nthree-inch stems. They keep awake all night, and all the air is heavy\\nand musky sweet because of them.\\n\\nFarther south on the trail there will be poppies meeting ankle deep,\\nand singly, peacock-painted bubbles of calochortus blown out at the\\ntops of tall stems. But before the season is in tune for the gayer\\nblossoms the best display of color is in the lupin wash. There is\\nalways a lupin wash somewhere on a mesa trail,--a broad, shallow,\\ncobble-paved sink of vanished waters, where the hummocks of _Lupinus\\nornatus_ run a delicate gamut from silvery green of spring to silvery\\nwhite of winter foliage. They look in fullest leaf, except for color,\\nmost like the huddled huts of the campoodie, and the largest of them\\nmight be a man’s length in diameter. In their season, which is after\\nthe gilias are at their best, and before the larkspurs are ripe for\\npollen gathering, every terminal whorl of the lupin sends up its\\nblossom stalk, not holding any constant blue, but paling and purpling\\nto guide the friendly bee to virginal honey sips, or away from the\\nperfected and depleted flower. The length of the blossom stalk conforms\\nto the rounded contour of the plant, and of these there will be a\\nmillion moving indescribably in the airy current that flows down the\\nswale of the wash.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThere is always a little wind on the mesa, a sliding current of cooler\\nair going down the face of the mountain of its own momentum, but not to\\ndisturb the silence of great space. Passing the wide mouths of cañons,\\none gets the effect of whatever is doing in them, openly or behind a\\nscreen of cloud,--thunder of falls, wind in the pine leaves, or rush\\nand roar of rain. The rumor of tumult grows and dies in passing, as\\nfrom open doors gaping on a village street, but does not impinge on the\\neffect of solitariness. In quiet weather mesa days have no parallel for\\nstillness, but the night silence breaks into certain mellow or poignant\\nnotes. Late afternoons the burrowing owls may be seen blinking at the\\ndoors of their hummocks with perhaps four or five elfish nestlings\\narow, and by twilight begin a soft _whoo-oo-ing_, rounder, sweeter,\\nmore incessant in mating time. It is not possible to disassociate\\nthe call of the burrowing owl from the late slant light of the mesa.\\nIf the fine vibrations which are the golden-violet glow of spring\\ntwilights were to tremble into sound, it would be just that mellow\\ndouble note breaking along the blossom-tops. While the glow holds one\\nsees the thistle-down flights and pouncings after prey, and on into\\nthe dark hears their soft _pus-ssh!_ clearing out of the trail ahead.\\nMaybe the pin-point shriek of field mouse or kangaroo rat that pricks\\nthe wakeful pauses of the night is extorted by these mellow-voiced\\nplunderers, though it is just as like to be the work of the red fox on\\nhis twenty-mile constitutional.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nBoth the red fox and the coyote are free of the night hours, and both\\nkillers for the pure love of slaughter. The fox is no great talker, but\\nthe coyote goes garrulously through the dark in twenty keys at once,\\ngossip, warning, and abuse. They are light treaders, the split-feet,\\nso that the solitary camper sees their eyes about him in the dark\\nsometimes, and hears the soft intake of breath when no leaf has\\nstirred and no twig snapped underfoot. The coyote is your real lord\\nof the mesa, and so he makes sure you are armed with no long black\\ninstrument to spit your teeth into his vitals at a thousand yards, is\\nboth bold and curious. Not so bold, however, as the badger and not so\\nmuch of a curmudgeon. This shortlegged meat-eater loves half lights and\\nlowering days, has no friends, no enemies, and disowns his offspring.\\nVery likely if he knew how hawk and crow dog him for dinners, he would\\nresent it. But the badger is not very well contrived for looking up\\nor far to either side. Dull afternoons he may be met nosing a trail\\nhot-foot to the home of ground rat or squirrel, and is with difficulty\\npersuaded to give the right of way. The badger is a pot-hunter and no\\nsportsman. Once at the hill, he dives for the central chamber, his\\nsharp-clawed, splayey feet splashing up the sand like a bather in the\\nsurf. He is a swift trailer, but not so swift or secretive but some\\nsmall sailing hawk or lazy crow, perhaps one or two of each, has spied\\nupon him and come drifting down the wind to the killing.\\n\\nNo burrower is so unwise as not to have several exits from his dwelling\\nunder protecting shrubs. When the badger goes down, as many of the\\nfurry people as are not caught napping come up by the back doors, and\\nthe hawks make short work of them. I suspect that the crows get nothing\\nbut the gratification of curiosity and the pickings of some secret\\nstore of seeds unearthed by the badger. Once the excavation begins they\\nwalk about expectantly, but the little gray hawks beat slow circles\\nabout the doors of exit, and are wiser in their generation, though they\\ndo not look it.\\n\\nThere are always solitary hawks sailing above the mesa, and where some\\nblue tower of silence lifts out of the neighboring range, an eagle\\nhanging dizzily, and always buzzards high up in the thin, translucent\\nair making a merry-go-round. Between the coyote and the birds of\\ncarrion the mesa is kept clear of miserable dead.\\n\\nThe wind, too, is a besom over the treeless spaces, whisking new sand\\nover the litter of the scant-leaved shrubs, and the little doorways\\nof the burrowers are as trim as city fronts. It takes man to leave\\nunsightly scars on the face of the earth. Here on the mesa the\\nabandoned campoodies of the Paiutes are spots of desolation long after\\nthe wattles of the huts have warped in the brush heaps. The campoodies\\nare near the watercourses, but never in the swale of the stream. The\\nPaiute seeks rising ground, depending on air and sun for purification\\nof his dwelling, and when it becomes wholly untenable, moves.\\n\\nA campoodie at noontime, when there is no smoke rising and no stir of\\nlife, resembles nothing so much as a collection of prodigious wasps’\\nnests. The huts are squat and brown and chimneyless, facing east, and\\nthe inhabitants have the faculty of quail for making themselves scarce\\nin the underbrush at the approach of strangers. But they are really\\nnot often at home during midday, only the blind and incompetent left\\nto keep the camp. These are working hours, and all across the mesa\\none sees the women whisking seeds of _chia_ into their spoon-shaped\\nbaskets, these emptied again into the huge conical carriers, supported\\non the shoulders by a leather band about the forehead.\\n\\nMornings and late afternoons one meets the men singly and afoot on\\nunguessable errands, or riding shaggy, browbeaten ponies, with game\\nslung across the saddle-bows. This might be deer or even antelope,\\nrabbits, or, very far south towards Shoshone Land, lizards.\\n\\nThere are myriads of lizards on the mesa, little gray darts, or larger\\nsalmon-sided ones that may be found swallowing their skins in the\\nsafety of a prickle-bush in early spring. Now and then a palm’s breadth\\nof the trail gathers itself together and scurries off with a little\\nrustle under the brush, to resolve itself into sand again. This is pure\\nwitchcraft. If you succeed in catching it in transit, it loses its\\npower and becomes a flat, horned, toad-like creature, horrid looking\\nand harmless, of the color of the soil; and the curio dealer will give\\nyou two bits for it, to stuff.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMen have their season on the mesa as much as plants and four-footed\\nthings, and one is not like to meet them out of their time. For\\nexample, at the time of _rodeos_, which is perhaps April, one meets\\nfree riding vaqueros who need no trails and can find cattle where to\\nthe layman no cattle exist. As early as February bands of sheep work up\\nfrom the south to the high Sierra pastures. It appears that shepherds\\nhave not changed more than sheep in the process of time. The shy hairy\\nmen who herd the tractile flocks might be, except for some added\\nclothing, the very brethren of David. Of necessity they are hardy,\\nsimple livers, superstitious, fearful, given to seeing visions, and\\nalmost without speech. It needs the bustle of shearings and copious\\nlibations of sour, weak wine to restore the human faculty. Petite Pete,\\nwho works a circuit up from the Ceriso to Red Butte and around by way\\nof Salt Flats, passes year by year on the mesa trail, his thick hairy\\nchest thrown open to all weathers, twirling his long staff, and dealing\\nbrotherly with his dogs, who are possibly as intelligent, certainly\\nhandsomer.\\n\\nA flock’s journey is seven miles, ten if pasture fails, in a windless\\nblur of dust, feeding as it goes, and resting at noons. Such hours Pete\\nweaves a little screen of twigs between his head and the sun--the rest\\nof him is as impervious as one of his own sheep--and sleeps while his\\ndogs have the flocks upon their consciences. At night, wherever he may\\nbe, there Pete camps, and fortunate the trail-weary traveler who falls\\nin with him. When the fire kindles and savory meat seethes in the pot,\\nwhen there is a drowsy blether from the flock, and far down the mesa\\nthe twilight twinkle of shepherd fires, when there is a hint of blossom\\nunderfoot and a heavenly whiteness on the hills, one harks back without\\neffort to Judæa and the Nativity. But one feels by day anything but\\ngood will to note the shorn shrubs and cropped blossom-tops. So many\\nseasons’ effort, so many suns and rains to make a pound of wool! And\\nthen there is the loss of ground-inhabiting birds that must fail from\\nthe mesa when few herbs ripen seed.\\n\\nOut West, the west of the mesas and the unpatented hills, there is more\\nsky than any place in the world. It does not sit flatly on the rim of\\nearth, but begins somewhere out in the space in which the earth is\\npoised, hollows more, and is full of clean winey winds. There are some\\nodors, too, that get into the blood. There is the spring smell of sage\\nthat is the warning that sap is beginning to work in a soil that looks\\nto have none of the juices of life in it; it is the sort of smell that\\nsets one thinking what a long furrow the plough would turn up here,\\nthe sort of smell that is the beginning of new leafage, is best at the\\nplant’s best, and leaves a pungent trail where wild cattle crop. There\\nis the smell of sage at sundown, burning sage from campoodies and sheep\\ncamps, that travels on the thin blue wraiths of smoke; the kind of\\nsmell that gets into the hair and garments, is not much liked except\\nupon long acquaintance, and every Paiute and shepherd smells of it\\nindubitably. There is the palpable smell of the bitter dust that comes\\nup from the alkali flats at the end of the dry seasons, and the smell\\nof rain from the wide-mouthed cañons. And last the smell of the salt\\ngrass country, which is the beginning of other things that are the end\\nof the mesa trail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BASKET MAKER\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n“A man,” says Seyavi of the campoodie, “must have a woman, but a woman\\nwho has a child will do very well.”\\n\\nThat was perhaps why, when she lost her mate in the dying struggle of\\nhis race, she never took another, but set her wit to fend for herself\\nand her young son. No doubt she was often put to it in the beginning to\\nfind food for them both. The Paiutes had made their last stand at the\\nborder of the Bitter Lake; battle-driven they died in its waters, and\\nthe land filled with cattle-men and adventurers for gold: this while\\nSeyavi and the boy lay up in the caverns of the Black Rock and ate tule\\nroots and fresh-water clams that they dug out of the slough bottoms\\nwith their toes. In the interim, while the tribes swallowed their\\ndefeat, and before the rumor of war died out, they must have come very\\nnear to the bare core of things. That was the time Seyavi learned the\\nsufficiency of mother wit, and how much more easily one can do without\\na man than might at first be supposed.\\n\\nTo understand the fashion of any life, one must know the land it is\\nlived in and the procession of the year. This valley is a narrow one, a\\nmere trough between hills, a draught for storms, hardly a crow’s flight\\nfrom the sharp Sierras of the Snows to the curled, red and ochre,\\nuncomforted, bare ribs of Waban. Midway of the groove runs a burrowing,\\ndull river, nearly a hundred miles from where it cuts the lava flats\\nof the north to its widening in a thick, tideless pool of a lake.\\nHereabouts the ranges have no foothills, but rise up steeply from the\\nbench lands above the river. Down from the Sierras, for the east ranges\\nhave almost no rain, pour glancing white floods toward the lowest land,\\nand all beside them lie the campoodies, brown wattled brush heaps,\\nlooking east.\\n\\nIn the river are mussels, and reeds that have edible white roots, and\\nin the soddy meadows tubers of joint grass; all these at their best\\nin the spring. On the slope the summer growth affords seeds; up the\\nsteep the one-leafed pines, an oily nut. That was really all they could\\ndepend upon, and that only at the mercy of the little gods of frost\\nand rain. For the rest it was cunning against cunning, caution against\\nskill, against quacking hordes of wild-fowl in the tulares, against\\npronghorn and bighorn and deer. You can guess, however, that all this\\nwarring of rifles and bowstrings, this influx of overlording whites,\\nhad made game wilder and hunters fearful of being hunted. You can\\nsurmise also, for it was a crude time and the land was raw, that the\\nwomen became in turn the game of the conquerors.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThere used to be in the Little Antelope a she dog, stray or outcast,\\nthat had a litter in some forsaken lair, and ranged and foraged\\nfor them, slinking savage and afraid, remembering and mistrusting\\nhumankind, wistful, lean, and sufficient for her young. I have thought\\nSeyavi might have had days like that, and have had perfect leave to\\nthink, since she will not talk of it. Paiutes have the art of reducing\\nlife to its lowest ebb and yet saving it alive on grasshoppers,\\nlizards, and strange herbs; and that time must have left no shift\\nuntried. It lasted long enough for Seyavi to have evolved the\\nphilosophy of life which I have set down at the beginning. She had gone\\nbeyond learning to do for her son, and learned to believe it worth\\nwhile.\\n\\nIn our kind of society, when a woman ceases to alter the fashion of her\\nhair, you guess that she has passed the crisis of her experience. If\\nshe goes on crimping and uncrimping with the changing mode, it is safe\\nto suppose she has never come up against anything too big for her. The\\nIndian woman gets nearly the same personal note in the pattern of her\\nbaskets. Not that she does not make all kinds, carriers, water-bottles,\\nand cradles,--these are kitchen ware,--but her works of art are all of\\nthe same piece. Seyavi made flaring, flat-bottomed bowls, cooking pots\\nreally, when cooking was done by dropping hot stones into water-tight\\nfood baskets, and for decoration a design in colored bark of the\\nprocession of plumed crests of the valley quail. In this pattern she\\nhad made cooking pots in the golden spring of her wedding year, when\\nthe quail went up two and two to their resting places about the foot\\nof Oppapago. In this fashion she made them when, after pillage, it\\nwas possible to reinstate the housewifely crafts. Quail ran then in\\nthe Black Rock by hundreds,--so you will still find them in fortunate\\nyears,--and in the famine time the women cut their long hair to make\\nsnares when the flocks came morning and evening to the springs.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nSeyavi made baskets for love and sold them for money, in a generation\\nthat preferred iron pots for utility. Every Indian woman is an\\nartist,--sees, feels, creates, but does not philosophize about her\\nprocesses. Seyavi’s bowls are wonders of technical precision, inside\\nand out, the palm finds no fault with them, but the subtlest appeal is\\nin the sense that warns us of humanness in the way the design spreads\\ninto the flare of the bowl. There used to be an Indian woman at Olancha\\nwho made bottle-neck trinket baskets in the rattlesnake pattern, and\\ncould accommodate the design to the swelling bowl and flat shoulder of\\nthe basket without sensible disproportion, and so cleverly that you\\nmight own one a year without thinking how it was done; but Seyavi’s\\nbaskets had a touch beyond cleverness. The weaver and the warp lived\\nnext to the earth and were saturated with the same elements. Twice a\\nyear, in the time of white butterflies and again when young quail ran\\nneck and neck in the chaparral, Seyavi cut willows for basketry by\\nthe creek where it wound toward the river against the sun and sucking\\nwinds. It never quite reached the river except in far-between times\\nof summer flood, but it always tried, and the willows encouraged it\\nas much as they could. You nearly always found them a little farther\\ndown than the trickle of eager water. The Paiute fashion of counting\\ntime appeals to me more than any other calendar. They have no stamp of\\nheathen gods nor great ones, nor any succession of moons as have red\\nmen of the East and North, but count forward and back by the progress\\nof the season; the time of _taboose_, before the trout begin to leap,\\nthe end of the piñon harvest, about the beginning of deep snows. So\\nthey get nearer the sense of the season, which runs early or late\\naccording as the rains are forward or delayed. But whenever Seyavi\\ncut willows for baskets was always a golden time, and the soul of the\\nweather went into the wood. If you had ever owned one of Seyavi’s\\ngolden russet cooking bowls with the pattern of plumed quail, you would\\nunderstand all this without saying anything.\\n\\nBefore Seyavi made baskets for the satisfaction of desire,--for that is\\na house-bred theory of art that makes anything more of it,--she danced\\nand dressed her hair. In those days, when the spring was at flood and\\nthe blood pricked to the mating fever, the maids chose their flowers,\\nwreathed themselves, and danced in the twilights, young desire crying\\nout to young desire. They sang what the heart prompted, what the flower\\nexpressed, what boded in the mating weather.\\n\\n“And what flower did you wear, Seyavi?”\\n\\n“I, ah,--the white flower of twining (clematis), on my body and my\\nhair, and so I sang:--\\n\\n    “I am the white flower of twining,\\n    Little white flower by the river,\\n    Oh, flower that twines close by the river;\\n    Oh, trembling flower!\\n    So trembles the maiden heart.”\\n\\nSo sang Seyavi of the campoodie before she made baskets, and in her\\nlater days laid her arms upon her knees and laughed in them at the\\nrecollection. But it was not often she would say so much, never\\nunderstanding the keen hunger I had for bits of lore and the “fool\\ntalk” of her people. She had fed her young son with meadowlarks’\\ntongues, to make him quick of speech; but in late years was loath to\\nadmit it, though she had come through the period of unfaith in the lore\\nof the clan with a fine appreciation of its beauty and significance.\\n\\n“What good will your dead get, Seyavi, of the baskets you burn?” said\\nI, coveting them for my own collection.\\n\\nThus Seyavi, “As much good as yours of the flowers you strew.”\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nOppapago looks on Waban, and Waban on Coso and the Bitter Lake, and\\nthe campoodie looks on these three; and more, it sees the beginning\\nof winds along the foot of Coso, the gathering of clouds behind the\\nhigh ridges, the spring flush, the soft spread of wild almond bloom\\non the mesa. These first, you understand, are the Paiute’s walls, the\\nother his furnishings. Not the wattled hut is his home, but the land,\\nthe winds, the hill front, the stream. These he cannot duplicate at\\nany furbisher’s shop as you who live within doors, who, if your purse\\nallows, may have the same home at Sitka and Samarcand. So you see how\\nit is that the homesickness of an Indian is often unto death, since he\\ngets no relief from it; neither wind nor weed nor sky-line, nor any\\naspect of the hills of a strange land sufficiently like his own. So it\\nwas when the government reached out for the Paiutes, they gathered into\\nthe Northern Reservation only such poor tribes as could devise no other\\nend of their affairs. Here, all along the river, and south to Shoshone\\nLand, live the clans who owned the earth, fallen into the deplorable\\ncondition of hangers-on. Yet you hear them laughing at the hour when\\nthey draw in to the campoodie after labor, when there is a smell of\\nmeat and the steam of the cooking pots goes up against the sun. Then\\nthe children lie with their toes in the ashes to hear tales; then they\\nare merry, and have the joys of repletion and the nearness of their\\nkind. They have their hills, and though jostled are sufficiently free\\nto get some fortitude for what will come. For now you shall hear of the\\nend of the basket maker.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIn her best days Seyavi was most like Deborah, deep bosomed, broad in\\nthe hips, quick in counsel, slow of speech, esteemed of her people.\\nThis was that Seyavi who reared a man by her own hand, her own wit,\\nand none other. When the townspeople began to take note of her--and it\\nwas some years after the war before there began to be any towns--she\\nwas then in the quick maturity of primitive women; but when I knew her\\nshe seemed already old. Indian women do not often live to great age,\\nthough they look incredibly steeped in years. They have the wit to win\\nsustenance from the raw material of life without intervention, but\\nthey have not the sleek look of the women whom the social organization\\nconspires to nourish. Seyavi had somehow squeezed out of her daily\\nround a spiritual ichor that kept the skill in her knotted fingers\\nlong after the accustomed time, but that also failed. By all counts\\nshe would have been about sixty years old when it came her turn to sit\\nin the dust on the sunny side of the wickiup, with little strength\\nleft for anything but looking. And in time she paid the toll of the\\nsmoky huts and became blind. This is a thing so long expected by the\\nPaiutes that when it comes they find it neither bitter nor sweet, but\\ntolerable because common. There were three other blind women in the\\ncampoodie, withered fruit on a bough, but they had memory and speech.\\nBy noon of the sun there were never any left in the campoodie but\\nthese or some mother of weanlings, and they sat to keep the ashes warm\\nupon the hearth. If it were cold, they burrowed in the blankets of the\\nhut; if it were warm, they followed the shadow of the wickiup around.\\nStir much out of their places they hardly dared, since one might not\\nhelp another; but they called, in high, old cracked voices, gossip and\\nreminder across the ash heaps.\\n\\nThen, if they have your speech or you theirs, and have an hour to\\nspare, there are things to be learned of life not set down in any\\nbooks, folk tales, famine tales, love and long-suffering and desire,\\nbut no whimpering. Now and then one or another of the blind keepers\\nof the camp will come across to where you sit gossiping, tapping her\\nway among the kitchen middens, guided by your voice that carries far in\\nthe clearness and stillness of mesa afternoons. But suppose you find\\nSeyavi retired into the privacy of her blanket, you will get nothing\\nfor that day. There is no other privacy possible in a campoodie. All\\nthe processes of life are carried on out of doors or behind the thin,\\ntwig-woven walls of the wickiup, and laughter is the only corrective\\nfor behavior. Very early the Indian learns to possess his countenance\\nin impassivity, to cover his head with his blanket. Something to wrap\\naround him is as necessary to the Paiute as to you your closet to pray\\nin.\\n\\nSo in her blanket Seyavi, sometime basket maker, sits by the unlit\\nhearths of her tribe and digests her life, nourishing her spirit\\nagainst the time of the spirit’s need, for she knows in fact quite as\\nmuch of these matters as you who have a larger hope, though she has\\nnone but the certainty that having borne herself courageously to this\\nend she will not be reborn a coyote.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE STREETS OF THE MOUNTAINS\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nAll streets of the mountains lead to the citadel; steep or slow they go\\nup to the core of the hills. Any trail that goes otherwhere must dip\\nand cross, sidle and take chances. Rifts of the hills open into each\\nother, and the high meadows are often wide enough to be called valleys\\nby courtesy; but one keeps this distinction in mind,--valleys are\\nthe sunken places of the earth, cañons are scored out by the glacier\\nploughs of God. They have a better name in the Rockies for these\\nhill-fenced open glades of pleasantness; they call them parks. Here and\\nthere in the hill country one comes upon blind gullies fronted by high\\nstony barriers. These head also for the heart of the mountains; their\\ndistinction is that they never get anywhere.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAll mountain streets have streams to thread them, or deep grooves where\\na stream might run. You would do well to avoid that range uncomforted\\nby singing floods. You will find it forsaken of most things but beauty\\nand madness and death and God. Many such lie east and north away from\\nthe mid Sierras, and quicken the imagination with the sense of purposes\\nnot revealed, but the ordinary traveler brings nothing away from them\\nbut an intolerable thirst.\\n\\nThe river cañons of the Sierras of the Snows are better worth while\\nthan most Broadways, though the choice of them is like the choice of\\nstreets, not very well determined by their names. There is always an\\namount of local history to be read in the names of mountain highways\\nwhere one touches the successive waves of occupation or discovery, as\\nin the old villages where the neighborhoods are not built but grow.\\nHere you have the Spanish Californian in _Cero Gordo_ and piñon; Symmes\\nand Shepherd, pioneers both; Tunawai, probably Shoshone; Oak Creek,\\nKearsarge,--easy to fix the date of that christening,--Tinpah, Paiute\\nthat; Mist Cañon and Paddy Jack’s. The streets of the west Sierras\\nsloping toward the San Joaquin are long and winding, but from the east,\\nmy country, a day’s ride carries one to the lake regions. The next day\\nreaches the passes of the high divide, but whether one gets passage\\ndepends a little on how many have gone that road before, and much on\\none’s own powers. The passes are steep and windy ridges, though not\\nthe highest. By two and three thousand feet the snow-caps overtop them.\\nIt is even possible to win through the Sierras without having passed\\nabove timber-line, but one misses a great exhilaration.\\n\\nThe shape of a new mountain is roughly pyramidal, running out\\ninto long shark-finned ridges that interfere and merge into other\\nthunder-splintered sierras. You get the saw-tooth effect from a\\ndistance, but the near-by granite bulk glitters with the terrible keen\\npolish of old glacial ages. I say terrible; so it seems. When those\\nglossy domes swim into the alpenglow, wet after rain, you conceive how\\nlong and imperturbable are the purposes of God.\\n\\nNever believe what you are told, that midsummer is the best time to go\\nup the streets of the mountain--well--perhaps for the merely idle or\\nsportsmanly or scientific; but for seeing and understanding, the best\\ntime is when you have the longest leave to stay. And here is a hint if\\nyou would attempt the stateliest approaches; travel light, and as much\\nas possible live off the land. Mulligatawny soup and tinned lobster\\nwill not bring you the favor of the woodlanders.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEvery cañon commends itself for some particular pleasantness; this\\nfor pines, another for trout, one for pure bleak beauty of granite\\nbuttresses, one for its far-flung irised falls; and as I say, though\\nsome are easier going, leads each to the cloud shouldering citadel.\\nFirst, near the cañon mouth you get the low-heading full-branched,\\none-leaf pines. That is the sort of tree to know at sight, for the\\nglobose, resin-dripping cones have palatable, nourishing kernels, the\\nmain harvest of the Paiutes. That perhaps accounts for their growing\\naccommodatingly below the limit of deep snows, grouped sombrely on\\nthe valleyward slopes. The real procession of the pines begins in the\\nrifts with the long-leafed _Pinus Jeffreyi_, sighing its soul away upon\\nthe wind. And it ought not to sigh in such good company. Here begins\\nthe manzanita, adjusting its tortuous stiff stems to the sharp waste\\nof boulders, its pale olive leaves twisting edgewise to the sleek,\\nruddy, chestnut stems; begins also the meadowsweet, burnished laurel,\\nand the million unregarded trumpets of the coral-red pentstemon. Wild\\nlife is likely to be busiest about the lower pine borders. One looks in\\nhollow trees and hiving rocks for wild honey. The drone of bees, the\\nchatter of jays, the hurry and stir of squirrels, is incessant; the\\nair is odorous and hot. The roar of the stream fills up the morning\\nand evening intervals, and at night the deer feed in the buckthorn\\nthickets. It is worth watching the year round in the purlieus of the\\nlong-leafed pines. One month or another you get sight or trail of most\\nroving mountain dwellers as they follow the limit of forbidding snows,\\nand more bloom than you can properly appreciate.\\n\\nWhatever goes up or comes down the streets of the mountains, water\\nhas the right of way; it takes the lowest ground and the shortest\\npassage. Where the rifts are narrow, and some of the Sierra cañons\\nare not a stone’s throw from wall to wall, the best trail for foot or\\nhorse winds considerably above the watercourses; but in a country of\\ncone-bearers there is usually a good strip of swardy sod along the\\ncañon floor. Pine woods, the short-leafed Balfour and Murryana of the\\nhigh Sierras, are sombre, rooted in the litter of a thousand years,\\nhushed, and corrective to the spirit. The trail passes insensibly into\\nthem from the black pines and a thin belt of firs. You look back as you\\nrise, and strain for glimpses of the tawny valley, blue glints of the\\nBitter Lake, and tender cloud films on the farther ranges. For such\\npictures the pine branches make a noble frame. Presently they close in\\nwholly; they draw mysteriously near, covering your tracks, giving up\\nthe trail indifferently, or with a secret grudge. You get a kind of\\nimpatience with their locked ranks, until you come out lastly on some\\nhigh, windy dome and see what they are about. They troop thickly up the\\nopen ways, river banks, and brook borders; up open swales of dribbling\\nsprings; swarm over old moraines; circle the peaty swamps and part\\nand meet about clean still lakes; scale the stony gullies; tormented,\\nbowed, persisting to the door of the storm chambers, tall priests to\\npray for rain. The spring winds lift clouds of pollen dust, finer than\\nfrankincense, and trail it out over high altars, staining the snow. No\\ndoubt they understand this work better than we; in fact they know no\\nother. “Come,” say the churches of the valleys, after a season of dry\\nyears, “let us pray for rain.” They would do better to plant more trees.\\n\\nIt is a pity we have let the gift of lyric improvisation die out.\\nSitting islanded on some gray peak above the encompassing wood, the\\nsoul is lifted up to sing the Iliad of the pines. They have no voice\\nbut the wind, and no sound of them rises up to the high places. But\\nthe waters, the evidences of their power, that go down the steep and\\nstony ways, the outlets of ice-bordered pools, the young rivers swaying\\nwith the force of their running, they sing and shout and trumpet at\\nthe falls, and the noise of it far outreaches the forest spires. You\\nsee from these conning towers how they call and find each other in\\nthe slender gorges; how they fumble in the meadows, needing the sheer\\nnearing walls to give them countenance and show the way; and how the\\npine woods are made glad by them.\\n\\nNothing else in the streets of the mountains gives such a sense of\\npageantry as the conifers; other trees, if there are any, are home\\ndwellers, like the tender fluttered, sisterhood of quaking asp. They\\ngrow in clumps by spring borders, and all their stems have a permanent\\ncurve toward the down slope, as you may also see in hillside pines,\\nwhere they have borne the weight of sagging drifts.\\n\\nWell up from the valley, at the confluence of cañons, are delectable\\nsummer meadows. Fireweed flames about them against the gray boulders;\\nstreams are open, go smoothly about the glacier slips and make\\ndeep bluish pools for trout. Pines raise statelier shafts and give\\nthemselves room to grow,--gentians, shinleaf, and little grass of\\nParnassus in their golden checkered shadows; the meadow is white with\\nviolets and all outdoors keeps the clock. For example, when the ripples\\nat the ford of the creek raise a clear half tone,--sign that the snow\\nwater has come down from the heated high ridges,--it is time to light\\nthe evening fire. When it drops off a note--but you will not know it\\nexcept the Douglas squirrel tells you with his high, fluty chirrup from\\nthe pines’ aerial gloom--sign that some star watcher has caught the\\nfirst far glint of the nearing sun. Whitney cries it from his vantage\\ntower; it flashes from Oppapago to the front of Williamson; LeConte\\nspeeds it to the westering peaks. The high rills wake and run, the\\nbirds begin. But down three thousand feet in the cañon, where you stir\\nthe fire under the cooking pot, it will not be day for an hour. It goes\\non, the play of light across the high places, rosy, purpling, tender,\\nglint and glow, thunder and windy flood, like the grave, exulting talk\\nof elders above a merry game.\\n\\nWho shall say what another will find most to his liking in the\\nstreets of the mountains. As for me, once set above the country of\\nthe silver firs, I must go on until I find white columbine. Around\\nthe amphitheatres of the lake regions and above them to the limit of\\nperennial drifts they gather flock-wise in splintered rock wastes. The\\ncrowds of them, the airy spread of sepals, the pale purity of the petal\\nspurs, the quivering swing of bloom, obsesses the sense. One must learn\\nto spare a little of the pang of inexpressible beauty, not to spend all\\none’s purse in one shop. There is always another year, and another.\\n\\nLingering on in the alpine regions until the first full snow, which is\\noften before the cessation of bloom, one goes down in good company.\\nFirst snows are soft and clogging and make laborious paths. Then it\\nis the roving inhabitants range down to the edge of the wood, below\\nthe limit of early storms. Early winter and early spring one may have\\nsight or track of deer and bear and bighorn, cougar and bobcat, about\\nthe thickets of buckthorn on open slopes between the black pines. But\\nwhen the ice crust is firm above the twenty foot drifts, they range far\\nand forage where they will. Often in midwinter will come, now and then,\\na long fall of soft snow piling three or four feet above the ice crust,\\nand work a real hardship for the dwellers of these streets. When such\\na storm portends the weather-wise black-tail will go down across the\\nvalley and up to the pastures of Waban where no more snow falls than\\nsuffices to nourish the sparsely growing pines. But the bighorn, the\\nwild sheep, able to bear the bitterest storms with no signs of stress,\\ncannot cope with the loose shifty snow. Never such a storm goes over\\nthe mountains that the Indians do not catch them floundering belly\\ndeep among the lower rifts. I have a pair of horns, inconceivably\\nheavy, that were borne as late as a year ago by a very monarch of the\\nflock whom death overtook at the mouth of Oak Creek after a week of wet\\nsnow. He met it as a king should, with no vain effort or trembling, and\\nit was wholly kind to take him so with four of his following rather\\nthan that the night prowlers should find him.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThere is always more life abroad in the winter hills than one looks to\\nfind, and much more in evidence than in summer weather. Light feet of\\nhare that make no print on the forest litter leave a wondrously plain\\ntrack in the snow. We used to look and look at the beginning of winter\\nfor the birds to come down from the pine lands; looked in the orchard\\nand stubble; looked north and south on the mesa for their migratory\\npassing, and wondered that they never came. Busy little grosbeaks\\npicked about the kitchen doors, and woodpeckers tapped the eves of\\nthe farm buildings, but we saw hardly any other of the frequenters of\\nthe summer cañons. After a while when we grew bold to tempt the snow\\nborders we found them in the street of the mountains. In the thick\\npine woods where the overlapping boughs hung with snow-wreaths make\\nwind-proof shelter tents, in a very community of dwelling, winter the\\nbird-folk who get their living from the persisting cones and the larvæ\\nharboring bark. Ground inhabiting species seek the dim snow chambers\\nof the chaparral. Consider how it must be in a hill-slope overgrown\\nwith stout-twigged, partly evergreen shrubs, more than man high, and\\nas thick as a hedge. Not all the cañon’s sifting of snow can fill the\\nintricate spaces of the hill tangles. Here and there an overhanging\\nrock, or a stiff arch of buckthorn, makes an opening to communicating\\nrooms and runways deep under the snow.\\n\\nThe light filtering through the snow walls is blue and ghostly,\\nbut serves to show seeds of shrubs and grass, and berries, and the\\nwind-built walls are warm against the wind. It seems that live plants,\\nespecially if they are evergreen and growing, give off heat; the snow\\nwall melts earliest from within and hollows to thinness before there is\\na hint of spring in the air. But you think of these things afterward.\\nUp in the street it has the effect of being done consciously; the\\nbuckthorns lean to each other and the drift to them, the little birds\\nrun in and out of their appointed ways with the greatest cheerfulness.\\nThey give almost no tokens of distress, and even if the winter tries\\nthem too much you are not to pity them. You of the house habit can\\nhardly understand the sense of the hills. No doubt the labor of\\nbeing comfortable gives you an exaggerated opinion of yourself, an\\nexaggerated pain to be set aside. Whether the wild things understand it\\nor not they adapt themselves to its processes with the greater ease.\\nThe business that goes on in the street of the mountain is tremendous,\\nworld-formative. Here go birds, squirrels, and red deer, children\\ncrying small wares and playing in the street, but they do not obstruct\\nits affairs. Summer is their holiday; “Come now,” says the lord of the\\nstreet, “I have need of a great work and no more playing.”\\n\\nBut they are left borders and breathing-space out of pure kindness.\\nThey are not pushed out except by the exigencies of the nobler plan\\nwhich they accept with a dignity the rest of us have not yet learned.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWATER BORDERS\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nI like that name the Indians give to the mountain of Lone Pine, and\\nfind it pertinent to my subject,--Oppapago, The Weeper. It sits\\neastward and solitary from the lordliest ranks of the Sierras, and\\nabove a range of little, old, blunt hills, and has a bowed, grave\\naspect as of some woman you might have known, looking out across the\\ngrassy barrows of her dead. From twin gray lakes under its noble brow\\nstream down incessant white and tumbling waters. “Mahala all time cry,”\\nsaid Winnenap´, drawing furrows in his rugged, wrinkled cheeks.\\n\\nThe origin of mountain streams is like the origin of tears, patent to\\nthe understanding but mysterious to the sense. They are always at it,\\nbut one so seldom catches them in the act. Here in the valley there is\\nno cessation of waters even in the season when the niggard frost gives\\nthem scant leave to run. They make the most of their midday hour, and\\ntinkle all night thinly under the ice. An ear laid to the snow catches\\na muffled hint of their eternal busyness fifteen or twenty feet under\\nthe cañon drifts, and long before any appreciable spring thaw, the\\nsagging edges of the snow bridges mark out the place of their running.\\nOne who ventures to look for it finds the immediate source of the\\nspring freshets--all the hill fronts furrowed with the reek of melting\\ndrifts, all the gravelly flats in a swirl of waters. But later, in June\\nor July, when the camping season begins, there runs the stream away\\nfull and singing, with no visible reinforcement other than an icy\\ntrickle from some high, belated clot of snow. Oftenest the stream drops\\nbodily from the bleak bowl of some alpine lake; sometimes breaks out of\\na hillside as a spring where the ear can trace it under the rubble of\\nloose stones to the neighborhood of some blind pool. But that leaves\\nthe lakes to be accounted for.\\n\\nThe lake is the eye of the mountain, jade green, placid, unwinking,\\nalso unfathomable. Whatever goes on under the high and stony brows is\\nguessed at. It is always a favorite local tradition that one or another\\nof the blind lakes is bottomless. Often they lie in such deep cairns of\\nbroken boulders that one never gets quite to them, or gets away unhurt.\\nOne such drops below the plunging slope that the Kearsarge trail winds\\nover, perilously, nearing the pass. It lies still and wickedly green in\\nits sharplipped cup, and the guides of that region love to tell of the\\npacks and pack animals it has swallowed up.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nBut the lakes of Oppapago are perhaps not so deep, less green than\\ngray, and better befriended. The ousel haunts them, while still hang\\nabout their coasts the thin undercut drifts that never quite leave\\nthe high altitudes. In and out of the bluish ice caves he flits and\\nsings, and his singing heard from above is sweet and uncanny like the\\nNixie’s chord. One finds butterflies, too, about these high, sharp\\nregions which might be called desolate, but will not by me who love\\nthem. This is above timber-line but not too high for comforting by\\nsucculent small herbs and golden tufted grass. A granite mountain does\\nnot crumble with alacrity, but once resolved to soil makes the best of\\nit. Every handful of loose gravel not wholly water leached affords\\na plant footing, and even in such unpromising surroundings there is\\na choice of locations. There is never going to be any communism of\\nmountain herbage, their affinities are too sure. Full in the runnels\\nof snow water on gravelly, open spaces in the shadow of a drift,\\none looks to find buttercups, frozen knee-deep by night, and owning\\nno desire but to ripen their fruit above the icy bath. Soppy little\\nplants of the portulaca and small, fine ferns shiver under the drip\\nof falls and in dribbling crevices. The bleaker the situation, so it\\nis near a stream border, the better the cassiope loves it. Yet I have\\nnot found it on the polished glacier slips, but where the country rock\\ncleaves and splinters in the high windy headlands that the wild sheep\\nfrequents, hordes and hordes of the white bells swing over matted,\\nmossy foliage. On Oppapago, which is also called Sheep Mountain, one\\nfinds not far from the beds of cassiope the ice-worn, stony hollows\\nwhere the bighorns cradle their young. These are above the wolf’s quest\\nand the eagle’s wont, and though the heather beds are softer, they are\\nneither so dry nor so warm, and here only the stars go by. No other\\nanimal of any pretensions makes a habitat of the alpine regions. Now\\nand then one gets a hint of some small, brown creature, rat or mouse\\nkind, that slips secretly among the rocks; no others adapt themselves\\nto desertness of aridity or altitude so readily as these ground\\ninhabiting, graminivorous species. If there is an open stream the trout\\ngo up the lake as far as the water breeds food for them, but the ousel\\ngoes farthest, for pure love of it.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nSince no lake can be at the highest point, it is possible to find\\nplant life higher than the water borders; grasses perhaps the highest,\\ngilias, royal blue trusses of polymonium, rosy plats of Sierra\\nprimroses. What one has to get used to in flowers at high altitudes is\\nthe bleaching of the sun. Hardly do they hold their virgin color for\\na day, and this early fading before their function is performed gives\\nthem a pitiful appearance not according with their hardihood. The color\\nscheme runs along the high ridges from blue to rosy purple, carmine and\\ncoral red; along the water borders it is chiefly white and yellow where\\nthe mimulus makes a vivid note, running into red when the two schemes\\nmeet and mix about the borders of the meadows, at the upper limit of\\nthe columbine.\\n\\nHere is the fashion in which a mountain stream gets down from the\\nperennial pastures of the snow to its proper level and identity as an\\nirrigating ditch. It slips stilly by the glacier scoured rim of an\\nice bordered pool, drops over sheer, broken ledges to another pool,\\ngathers itself, plunges headlong on a rocky ripple slope, finds a lake\\nagain, reinforced, roars downward to a pot-hole, foams and bridles,\\nglides a tranquil reach in some still meadow, tumbles into a sharp\\ngroove between hill flanks, curdles under the stream tangles, and so\\narrives at the open country and steadier going. Meadows, little strips\\nof alpine freshness, begin before the timber-line is reached. Here one\\ntreads on a carpet of dwarf willows, downy catkins of creditable size\\nand the greatest economy of foliage and stems. No other plant of high\\naltitudes knows its business so well. It hugs the ground, grows roots\\nfrom stem joints where no roots should be, grows a slender leaf or two\\nand twice as many erect full catkins that rarely, even in that short\\ngrowing season, fail of fruit. Dipping over banks in the inlets of the\\ncreeks, the fortunate find the rosy apples of the miniature manzanita,\\nbarely, but always quite sufficiently, borne above the spongy sod. It\\ndoes not do to be anything but humble in the alpine regions, but not\\nfearful. I have pawed about for hours in the chill sward of meadows\\nwhere one might properly expect to get one’s death, and got no harm\\nfrom it, except it might be Oliver Twist’s complaint. One comes soon\\nafter this to shrubby willows, and where willows are trout may be\\nconfidently looked for in most Sierra streams. There is no accounting\\nfor their distribution; though provident anglers have assisted nature\\nof late, one still comes upon roaring brown waters where trout might\\nvery well be, but are not.\\n\\nThe highest limit of conifers--in the middle Sierras, the white bark\\npine--is not along the water border. They come to it about the level\\nof the heather, but they have no such affinity for dampness as the\\ntamarack pines. Scarcely any bird-note breaks the stillness of the\\ntimber-line, but chipmunks inhabit here, as may be guessed by the\\ngnawed ruddy cones of the pines, and lowering hours the woodchucks come\\ndown to the water. On a little spit of land running into Windy Lake we\\nfound one summer the evidence of a tragedy; a pair of sheep’s horns not\\nfully grown caught in the crotch of a pine where the living sheep must\\nhave lodged them. The trunk of the tree had quite closed over them,\\nand the skull bones crumbled away from the weathered horn cases. We\\nhoped it was not too far out of the running of night prowlers to have\\nput a speedy end to the long agony, but we could not be sure. I never\\nliked the spit of Windy Lake again.\\n\\nIt seems that all snow nourished plants count nothing so excellent in\\ntheir kind as to be forehanded with their bloom, working secretly to\\nthat end under the high piled winters. The heathers begin by the lake\\nborders, while little sodden drifts still shelter under their branches.\\nI have seen the tiniest of them (_Kalmia glauca_) blooming, and with\\nwell-formed fruit, a foot away from a snowbank from which it could\\nhardly have emerged within a week. Somehow the soul of the heather\\nhas entered into the blood of the English-speaking. “And oh! is that\\nheather?” they say; and the most indifferent ends by picking a sprig of\\nit in a hushed, wondering way. One must suppose that the root of their\\nrespective races issued from the glacial borders at about the same\\nepoch, and remember their origin.\\n\\nAmong the pines where the slope of the land allows it, the streams\\nrun into smooth, brown, trout-abounding rills across open flats that\\nare in reality filled lake basins. These are the displaying grounds\\nof the gentians--blue--blue--eye-blue, perhaps, virtuous and likable\\nflowers. One is not surprised to learn that they have tonic properties.\\nBut if your meadow should be outside the forest reserve, and the sheep\\nhave been there, you will find little but the shorter, paler _G.\\nNewberryii_, and in the matted sods of the little tongues of greenness\\nthat lick up among the pines along the watercourses, white, scentless,\\nnearly stemless, alpine violets.\\n\\nAt about the nine thousand foot level and in the summer there will be\\nhosts of rosy-winged dodecatheon, called shooting-stars, outlining\\nthe crystal runnels in the sod. Single flowers have often a two-inch\\nspread of petal, and the full, twelve blossomed heads above the slender\\npedicels have the airy effect of wings.\\n\\nIt is about this level one looks to find the largest lakes with thick\\nranks of pines bearing down on them, often swamped in the summer floods\\nand paying the inevitable penalty for such encroachment. Here in wet\\ncoves of the hills harbors that crowd of bloom that makes the wonder of\\nthe Sierra cañons.\\n\\nThey drift under the alternate flicker and gloom of the windy rooms\\nof pines, in gray rock shelters, and by the ooze of blind springs, and\\ntheir juxtapositions are the best imaginable. Lilies come up out of\\nfern beds, columbine swings over meadowsweet, white rein-orchids quake\\nin the leaning grass. Open swales, where in wet years may be running\\nwater, are plantations of false hellebore (_Veratrum Californicum_),\\ntall, branched candelabra of greenish bloom above the sessile,\\nsheathing, boat-shaped leaves, semi-translucent in the sun. A stately\\nplant of the lily family, but why “false?” It is frankly offensive in\\nits character, and its young juices deadly as any hellebore that ever\\ngrew.\\n\\nLike most mountain herbs it has an uncanny haste to bloom. One hears\\nby night, when all the wood is still, the crepitatious rustle of the\\nunfolding leaves and the pushing flower-stalk within, that has open\\nblossoms before it has fairly uncramped from the sheath. It commends\\nitself by a certain exclusiveness of growth, taking enough room and\\nnever elbowing; for if the flora of the lake region has a fault it is\\nthat there is too much of it. We have more than three hundred species\\nfrom Kearsarge Cañon alone, and if that does not include them all it is\\nbecause they were already collected otherwhere.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nOne expects to find lakes down to about nine thousand feet, leading\\ninto each other by comparatively open ripple slopes and white cascades.\\nBelow the lakes are filled basins that are still spongy swamps, or\\nsubstantial meadows, as they get down and down.\\n\\nHere begin the stream tangles. On the east slopes of the middle Sierras\\nthe pines, all but an occasional yellow variety, desert the stream\\nborders about the level of the lowest lakes, and the birches and\\ntree-willows begin. The firs hold on almost to the mesa levels,--there\\nare no foothills on this eastern slope,--and whoever has firs misses\\nnothing else. It goes without saying that a tree that can afford to\\ntake fifty years to its first fruiting will repay acquaintance. It\\nkeeps, too, all that half century, a virginal grace of outline, but\\nhaving once flowered, begins quietly to put away the things of its\\nyouth. Year by year the lower rounds of boughs are shed, leaving\\nno scar; year by year the star-branched minarets approach the sky.\\nA fir-tree loves a water border, loves a long wind in a draughty\\ncañon, loves to spend itself secretly on the inner finishings of its\\nburnished, shapely cones. Broken open in mid-season the petal-shaped\\nscales show a crimson satin surface, perfect as a rose.\\n\\nThe birch--the brown-bark western birch characteristic of lower stream\\ntangles--is a spoil sport. It grows thickly to choke the stream that\\nfeeds it; grudges it the sky and space for angler’s rod and fly. The\\nwillows do better; painted-cup, cypripedium, and the hollow stalks\\nof span-broad white umbels, find a footing among their stems. But in\\ngeneral the steep plunges, the white swirls, green and tawny pools, the\\ngliding hush of waters between the meadows and the mesas afford little\\nfishing and few flowers.\\n\\nOne looks for these to begin again when once free of the rifted cañon\\nwalls; the high note of babble and laughter falls off to the steadier\\nmellow tone of a stream that knows its purpose and reflects the sky.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOTHER WATER BORDERS\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nIt is the proper destiny of every considerable stream in the west to\\nbecome an irrigating ditch. It would seem the streams are willing. They\\ngo as far as they can, or dare, toward the tillable lands in their own\\nboulder fenced gullies--but how much farther in the man-made waterways.\\nIt is difficult to come into intimate relations with appropriated\\nwaters; like very busy people they have no time to reveal themselves.\\nOne needs to have known an irrigating ditch when it was a brook, and to\\nhave lived by it, to mark the morning and evening tone of its crooning,\\nrising and falling to the excess of snow water; to have watched far\\nacross the valley, south to the Eclipse and north to the Twisted Dyke,\\nthe shining wall of the village water gate; to see still blue herons\\nstalking the little glinting weirs across the field.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nPerhaps to get into the mood of the waterways one needs to have seen\\nold Amos Judson asquat on the headgate with his gun, guarding his\\nwater-right toward the end of a dry summer. Amos owned the half of\\nTule Creek and the other half pertained to the neighboring Greenfields\\nranch. Years of a “short water crop,” that is, when too little snow\\nfell on the high pine ridges, or, falling, melted too early, Amos\\nheld that it took all the water that came down to make his half, and\\nmaintained it with a Winchester and a deadly aim. Jesus Montaña, first\\nproprietor of Greenfields,--you can see at once that Judson had the\\nracial advantage,--contesting the right with him, walked into five of\\nJudson’s bullets and his eternal possessions on the same occasion.\\nThat was the Homeric age of settlement and passed into tradition.\\nTwelve years later one of the Clarks, holding Greenfields, not so very\\ngreen by now, shot one of the Judsons. Perhaps he hoped that also might\\nbecome classic, but the jury found for manslaughter. It had the effect\\nof discouraging the Greenfields claim, but Amos used to sit on the\\nheadgate just the same, as quaint and lone a figure as the sandhill\\ncrane watching for water toads below the Tule drop. Every subsequent\\nowner of Greenfields bought it with Amos in full view. The last of\\nthese was Diedrick. Along in August of that year came a week of low\\nwater. Judson’s ditch failed and he went out with his rifle to learn\\nwhy. There on the headgate sat Diedrick’s frau with a long-handled\\nshovel across her lap and all the water turned into Diedrick’s ditch;\\nthere she sat knitting through the long sun, and the children brought\\nout her dinner. It was all up with Amos; he was too much of a gentleman\\nto fight a lady--that was the way he expressed it. She was a very large\\nlady, and a long-handled shovel is no mean weapon. The next year Judson\\nand Diedrick put in a modern water gauge and took the summer ebb in\\nequal inches. Some of the water-right difficulties are more squalid\\nthan this, some more tragic; but unless you have known them you cannot\\nvery well know what the water thinks as it slips past the gardens and\\nin the long slow sweeps of the canal. You get that sense of brooding\\nfrom the confined and sober floods, not all at once but by degrees,\\nas one might become aware of a middle-aged and serious neighbor who\\nhas had that in his life to make him so. It is the repose of the\\ncompletely accepted instinct.\\n\\nWith the water runs a certain following of thirsty herbs and shrubs.\\nThe willows go as far as the stream goes, and a bit farther on the\\nslightest provocation. They will strike root in the leak of a flume,\\nor the dribble of an overfull bank, coaxing the water beyond its\\nappointed bounds. Given a new waterway in a barren land, and in three\\nyears the willows have fringed all its miles of banks; three years more\\nand they will touch tops across it. It is perhaps due to the early\\nusurpation of the willows that so little else finds growing-room along\\nthe large canals. The birch beginning far back in the cañon tangles\\nis more conservative; it is shy of man haunts and needs to have the\\npermanence of its drink assured. It stops far short of the summer\\nlimit of waters, and I have never known it to take up a position on\\nthe banks beyond the ploughed lands. There is something almost like\\npremeditation in the avoidance of cultivated tracts by certain plants\\nof water borders. The clematis, mingling its foliage secretly with its\\nhost, comes down with the stream tangles to the village fences, skips\\nover to corners of little used pasture lands and the plantations that\\nspring up about waste water pools; but never ventures a footing in the\\ntrail of spade or plough; will not be persuaded to grow in any garden\\nplot. On the other hand, the horehound, the common European species\\nimported with the colonies, hankers after hedgerows and snug little\\nborders. It is more widely distributed than many native species, and\\nmay be always found along the ditches in the village corners, where it\\nis not appreciated. The irrigating ditch is an impartial distributer.\\nIt gathers all the alien weeds that come west in garden and grass seeds\\nand affords them harbor in its banks. There one finds the European\\nmallow (_Malva rotundifolia_) spreading out to the streets with the\\nsummer overflow, and every spring a dandelion or two, brought in with\\nthe blue grass seed, uncurls in the swardy soil. Farther than either\\nof these have come the lilies that the Chinese coolies cultivate in\\nadjacent mud holes for their foodful bulbs. The _seegoo_ establishes\\nitself very readily in swampy borders, and the white blossom spikes\\namong the arrow-pointed leaves are quite as acceptable to the eye as\\nany native species.\\n\\nIn the neighborhood of towns founded by the Spanish Californians,\\nwhether this plant is native to the locality or not, one can always\\nfind aromatic clumps of _yerba buena_, the “good herb” (_Micromeria\\nDouglassii_). The virtue of it as a febrifuge was taught to the mission\\nfathers by the neophytes, and wise old dames of my acquaintance have\\nworked astonishing cures with it and the succulent _yerba mansa_. This\\nlast is native to wet meadows and distinguished enough to have a family\\nall to itself.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhere the irrigating ditches are shallow and a little neglected, they\\nchoke quickly with watercress that multiplies about the lowest Sierra\\nsprings. It is characteristic of the frequenters of water borders near\\nman haunts, that they are chiefly of the sorts that are useful to\\nman, as if they made their services an excuse for the intrusion. The\\njoint-grass of soggy pastures produces edible, nut-flavored tubers,\\ncalled by the Indians _taboose_. The common reed of the ultramontane\\nmarshes (here _Phragmites vulgaris_), a very stately, whispering reed,\\nlight and strong for shafts or arrows, affords sweet sap and pith which\\nmakes a passable sugar.\\n\\nIt seems the secrets of plant powers and influences yield themselves\\nmost readily to primitive peoples, at least one never hears of the\\nknowledge coming from any other source. The Indian never concerns\\nhimself, as the botanist and the poet, with the plant’s appearances and\\nrelations, but with what it can do for him. It can do much, but how do\\nyou suppose he finds it out; what instincts or accidents guide him? How\\ndoes a cat know when to eat catnip? Why do western bred cattle avoid\\nloco weed, and strangers eat it and go mad? One might suppose that in a\\ntime of famine the Paiutes digged wild parsnip in meadow corners and\\ndied from eating it, and so learned to produce death swiftly and at\\nwill. But how did they learn, repenting in the last agony, that animal\\nfat is the best antidote for its virulence; and who taught them that\\nthe essence of joint pine (_Ephedra nevadensis_), which looks to have\\nno juice in it of any sort, is efficacious in stomachic disorders. But\\nthey so understand and so use. One believes it to be a sort of instinct\\natrophied by disuse in a complexer civilization. I remember very well\\nwhen I came first upon a wet meadow of _yerba mansa_, not knowing its\\nname or use. It _looked_ potent; the cool, shiny leaves, the succulent,\\npink stems and fruity bloom. A little touch, a hint, a word, and I\\nshould have known what use to put them to. So I felt, unwilling to\\nleave it until we had come to an understanding. So a musician might\\nhave felt in the presence of an instrument known to be within his\\nprovince, but beyond his power. It was with the relieved sense of\\nhaving shaped a long surmise that I watched the Señora Romero make a\\npoultice of it for my burned hand.\\n\\nOn, down from the lower lakes to the village weirs, the brown and\\ngolden disks of _helenum_ have beauty as a sufficient excuse for\\nbeing. The plants anchor out on tiny capes, or mid-stream islets,\\nwith the nearly sessile radicle leaves submerged. The flowers keep up\\na constant trepidation in time with the hasty water beating at their\\nstems, a quivering, instinct with life, that seems always at the point\\nof breaking into flight; just as the babble of the watercourses always\\napproaches articulation but never quite achieves it. Although of wide\\nrange the helenum never makes itself common through profusion, and\\nmay be looked for in the same places from year to year. Another lake\\ndweller that comes down to the ploughed lands is the red columbine (_C.\\ntruncata_). It requires no encouragement other than shade, but grows\\ntoo rank in the summer heats and loses its wildwood grace. A common\\nenough orchid in these parts is the false lady’s slipper (_Epipactis\\ngigantea_), one that springs up by any water where there is sufficient\\ngrowth of other sorts to give it countenance. It seems to thrive best\\nin an atmosphere of suffocation.\\n\\nThe middle Sierras fall off abruptly eastward toward the high valleys.\\nPeaks of the fourteen thousand class, belted with sombre swathes of\\npine, rise almost directly from the bench lands with no foothill\\napproaches. At the lower edge of the bench or mesa the land falls\\naway, often by a fault, to the river hollows, and along the drop one\\nlooks for springs or intermittent swampy swales. Here the plant world\\nresembles a little the lake gardens, modified by altitude and the use\\nthe town folk put it to for pasture. Here are cress, blue violets,\\npotentilla, and, in the damp of the willow fence-rows, white false\\nasphodels. I am sure we make too free use of this word _false_ in\\nnaming plants--false mallow, false lupine, and the like. The asphodel\\nis at least no falsifier, but a true lily by all the heaven-set marks,\\nthough small of flower and run mostly to leaves, and should have a name\\nthat gives it credit for growing up in such celestial semblance. Native\\nto the mesa meadows is a pale iris, gardens of it acres wide, that in\\nthe spring season of full bloom make an airy fluttering as of azure\\nwings. Single flowers are too thin and sketchy of outline to affect the\\nimagination, but the full fields have the misty blue of mirage waters\\nrolled across desert sand, and quicken the senses to the anticipation\\nof things ethereal. A very poet’s flower, I thought; not fit for\\ngathering up, and proving a nuisance in the pastures, therefore needing\\nto be the more loved. And one day I caught Winnenap´ drawing out from\\nmid leaf a fine strong fibre for making snares. The borders of the iris\\nfields are pure gold, nearly sessile buttercups and a creeping-stemmed\\ncomposite of a redder hue. I am convinced that English-speaking\\nchildren will always have buttercups. If they do not light upon the\\noriginal companion of little frogs they will take the next best and\\ncherish it accordingly. I find five unrelated species loved by that\\nname, and as many more and as inappropriately called cowslips.\\n\\nBy every mesa spring one may expect to find a single shrub of the\\nbuckthorn, called of old time _Cascara sagrada_--the sacred bark. Up\\nin the cañons, within the limit of the rains, it seeks rather a stony\\nslope, but in the dry valleys is not found away from water borders.\\n\\nIn all the valleys and along the desert edges of the west are\\nconsiderable areas of soil sickly with alkali-collecting pools, black\\nand evil-smelling like old blood. Very little grows hereabout but\\nthick-leaved pickle weed. Curiously enough, in this stiff mud, along\\nroadways where there is frequently a little leakage from canals, grows\\nthe only western representative of the true heliotropes (_Heliotropium\\ncurassavicum_). It has flowers of faded white, foliage of faded\\ngreen, resembling the “live-for-ever” of old gardens and graveyards,\\nbut even less attractive. After so much schooling in the virtues\\nof water-seeking plants, one is not surprised to learn that its\\nmucilaginous sap has healing powers.\\n\\nLast and inevitable resort of overflow waters is the tulares, great\\nwastes of reeds (_Juncus_) in sickly, slow streams. The reeds, called\\ntules, are ghostly pale in winter, in summer deep poisonous-looking\\ngreen, the waters thick and brown; the reed beds breaking into dingy\\npools, clumps of rotting willows, narrow winding water lanes and\\nsinking paths. The tules grow inconceivably thick in places, standing\\nman-high above the water; cattle, no, not any fish nor fowl can\\npenetrate them. Old stalks succumb slowly; the bed soil is quagmire,\\nsettling with the weight as it fills and fills. Too slowly for\\ncounting they raise little islands from the bog and reclaim the land.\\nThe waters pushed out cut deeper channels, gnaw off the edges of the\\nsolid earth.\\n\\nThe tulares are full of mystery and malaria. That is why we have meant\\nto explore them and have never done so. It must be a happy mystery.\\nSo you would think to hear the redwinged blackbirds proclaim it clear\\nMarch mornings. Flocks of them, and every flock a myriad, shelter in\\nthe dry, whispering stems. They make little arched runways deep into\\nthe heart of the tule beds. Miles across the valley one hears the\\nclamor of their high, keen flutings in the mating weather.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWild fowl, quacking hordes of them, nest in the tulares. Any day’s\\nventure will raise from open shallows the great blue heron on his\\nhollow wings. Chill evenings the mallard drakes cry continually from\\nthe glassy pools, the bittern’s hollow boom rolls along the water\\npaths. Strange and far-flown fowl drop down against the saffron, autumn\\nsky. All day wings beat above it hazy with speed; long flights of\\ncranes glimmer in the twilight. By night one wakes to hear the clanging\\ngeese go over. One wishes for, but gets no nearer speech from those the\\nreedy fens have swallowed up. What they do there, how fare, what find,\\nis the secret of the tulares.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNURSLINGS OF THE SKY\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nChoose a hill country for storms. There all the business of the weather\\nis carried on above your horizon and loses its terror in familiarity.\\nWhen you come to think about it, the disastrous storms are on the\\nlevels, sea or sand or plains. There you get only a hint of what is\\nabout to happen, the fume of the gods rising from their meeting place\\nunder the rim of the world; and when it breaks upon you there is no\\nstay nor shelter. The terrible mewings and mouthings of a Kansas wind\\nhave the added terror of viewlessness. You are lapped in them like\\nuprooted grass; suspect them of a personal grudge. But the storms of\\nhill countries have other business. They scoop watercourses, manure\\nthe pines, twist them to a finer fibre, fit the firs to be masts and\\nspars, and, if you keep reasonably out of the track of their affairs,\\ndo you no harm.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThey have habits to be learned, appointed paths, seasons, and warnings,\\nand they leave you in no doubt about their performances. One who builds\\nhis house on a water scar or the rubble of a steep slope must take\\nchances. So they did in Overtown who built in the wash of Argus water,\\nand at Kearsarge at the foot of a steep, treeless swale. After twenty\\nyears Argus water rose in the wash against the frail houses, and the\\npiled snows of Kearsarge slid down at a thunder peal over the cabins\\nand the camp, but you could conceive that it was the fault of neither\\nthe water nor the snow.\\n\\nThe first effect of cloud study is a sense of presence and intention\\nin storm processes. Weather does not happen. It is the visible\\nmanifestation of the Spirit moving itself in the void. It gathers\\nitself together under the heavens; rains, snows, yearns mightily in\\nwind, smiles; and the Weather Bureau, situated advantageously for that\\nvery business, taps the record on his instruments and going out on the\\nstreets denies his God, not having gathered the sense of what he has\\nseen. Hardly anybody takes account of the fact that John Muir, who\\nknows more of mountain storms than any other, is a devout man.\\n\\nOf the high Sierras choose the neighborhood of the splintered peaks\\nabout the Kern and King’s river divide for storm study, or the short,\\nwide-mouthed cañons opening eastward on high valleys. Days when the\\nhollows are steeped in a warm, winey flood the clouds come walking on\\nthe floor of heaven, flat and pearly gray beneath, rounded and pearly\\nwhite above. They gather flock-wise, moving on the level currents\\nthat roll about the peaks, lock hands and settle with the cooler air,\\ndrawing a veil about those places where they do their work. If their\\nmeeting or parting takes place at sunrise or sunset, as it often\\ndoes, one gets the splendor of the apocalypse. There will be cloud\\npillars miles high, snow-capped, glorified, and preserving an orderly\\nperspective before the unbarred door of the sun, or perhaps mere ghosts\\nof clouds that dance to some pied piper of an unfelt wind. But be it\\nday or night, once they have settled to their work, one sees from the\\nvalley only the blank wall of their tents stretched along the ranges.\\nTo get the real effect of a mountain storm you must be inside.\\n\\nOne who goes often into a hill country learns not to say: What if it\\nshould rain? It always does rain somewhere among the peaks: the unusual\\nthing is that one should escape it. You might suppose that if you took\\nany account of plant contrivances to save their pollen powder against\\nshowers. Note how many there are deep-throated and bell-flowered like\\nthe pentstemons, how many have nodding pedicels as the columbine, how\\nmany grow in copse shelters and grow there only. There is keen delight\\nin the quick showers of summer cañons, with the added comfort, born\\nof experience, of knowing that no harm comes of a wetting at high\\naltitudes. The day is warm; a white cloud spies over the cañon wall,\\nslips up behind the ridge to cross it by some windy pass, obscures your\\nsun. Next you hear the rain drum on the broad-leaved hellebore, and\\nbeat down the mimulus beside the brook. You shelter on the lee of some\\nstrong pine with shut-winged butterflies and merry, fiddling creatures\\nof the wood. Runnels of rain water from the glacier slips swirl through\\nthe pine needles into rivulets; the streams froth and rise in their\\nbanks. The sky is white with cloud; the sky is gray with rain; the sky\\nis clear. The summer showers leave no wake.\\n\\nSuch as these follow each other day by day for weeks in August weather.\\nSometimes they chill suddenly into wet snow that packs about the\\nlake gardens clear to the blossom frills, and melts away harmlessly.\\nSometimes one has the good fortune from a heather-grown headland to\\nwatch a rain-cloud forming in mid-air. Out over meadow or lake region\\nbegins a little darkling of the sky,--no cloud, no wind, just a\\nsmokiness such as spirits materialize from in witch stories.\\n\\nIt rays out and draws to it some floating films from secret cañons.\\nRain begins, “slow dropping veil of thinnest lawn;” a wind comes up and\\ndrives the formless thing across a meadow, or a dull lake pitted by the\\nglancing drops, dissolving as it drives. Such rains relieve like tears.\\n\\nThe same season brings the rains that have work to do, ploughing\\nstorms that alter the face of things. These come with thunder and\\nthe play of live fire along the rocks. They come with great winds\\nthat try the pines for their work upon the seas and strike out the\\nunfit. They shake down avalanches of splinters from sky-line pinnacles\\nand raise up sudden floods like battle fronts in the cañons against\\ntowns, trees, and boulders. They would be kind if they could, but\\nhave more important matters. Such storms, called cloud-bursts by\\nthe country folk, are not rain, rather the spillings of Thor’s cup,\\njarred by the Thunderer. After such a one the water that comes up in\\nthe village hydrants miles away is white with forced bubbles from the\\nwind-tormented streams.\\n\\nAll that storms do to the face of the earth you may read in the\\ngeographies, but not what they do to our contemporaries. I remember one\\nnight of thunderous rain made unendurably mournful by the houseless cry\\nof a cougar whose lair, and perhaps his family, had been buried under\\na slide of broken boulders on the slope of Kearsarge. We had heard the\\nheavy denotation of the slide about the hour of the alpenglow, a pale\\nrosy interval in a darkling air, and judged he must have come from\\nhunting to the ruined cliff and paced the night out before it, crying\\na very human woe. I remember, too, in that same season of storms, a\\nlake made milky white for days, and crowded out of its bed by clay\\nwashed into it by a fury of rain, with the trout floating in it belly\\nup, stunned by the shock of the sudden flood. But there were trout\\nenough for what was left of the lake next year and the beginning of a\\nmeadow about its upper rim. What taxed me most in the wreck of one of\\nmy favorite cañons by cloudburst was to see a bobcat mother mouthing\\nher drowned kittens in the ruined lair built in the wash, far above\\nthe limit of accustomed waters, but not far enough for the unexpected.\\nAfter a time you get the point of view of gods about these things to\\nsave you from being too pitiful.\\n\\nThe great snows that come at the beginning of winter, before there is\\nyet any snow except the perpetual high banks, are best worth while to\\nwatch. These come often before the late bloomers are gone and while\\nthe migratory birds are still in the piney woods. Down in the valley\\nyou see little but the flocking of blackbirds in the streets, or the\\nlow flight of mallards over the tulares, and the gathering of clouds\\nbehind Williamson. First there is a waiting stillness in the wood; the\\npine-trees creak although there is no wind, the sky glowers, the firs\\nrock by the water borders. The noise of the creek rises insistently and\\nfalls off a full note like a child abashed by sudden silence in the\\nroom. This changing of the stream-tone following tardily the changes\\nof the sun on melting snows is most meaningful of wood notes. After\\nit runs a little trumpeter wind to cry the wild creatures to their\\nholes. Sometimes the warning hangs in the air for days with increasing\\nstillness. Only Clark’s crow and the strident jays make light of it;\\nonly they can afford to. The cattle get down to the foothills and\\nground inhabiting creatures make fast their doors. It grows chill,\\nblind clouds fumble in the cañons; there will be a roll of thunder,\\nperhaps, or a flurry of rain, but mostly the snow is born in the air\\nwith quietness and the sense of strong white pinions softly stirred. It\\nincreases, is wet and clogging, and makes a white night of midday.\\n\\nThere is seldom any wind with first snows, more often rain, but later,\\nwhen there is already a smooth foot or two over all the slopes, the\\ndrifts begin. The late snows are fine and dry, mere ice granules at the\\nwind’s will. Keen mornings after a storm they are blown out in wreaths\\nand banners from the high ridges sifting into the cañons.\\n\\nOnce in a year or so we have a “big snow.” The cloud tents are widened\\nout to shut in the valley and an outlying range or two and are drawn\\ntight against the sun. Such a storm begins warm, with a dry white mist\\nthat fills and fills between the ridges, and the air is thick with\\nformless groaning. Now for days you get no hint of the neighboring\\nranges until the snows begin to lighten and some shouldering peak\\nlifts through a rent. Mornings after the heavy snows are steely blue,\\ntwo-edged with cold, divinely fresh and still, and these are times\\nto go up to the pine borders. There you may find floundering in the\\nunstable drifts “tainted wethers” of the wild sheep, faint from age and\\nhunger; easy prey. Even the deer make slow going in the thick fresh\\nsnow, and once we found a wolverine going blind and feebly in the white\\nglare.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nNo tree takes the snow stress with such ease as the silver fir. The\\nstar-whorled, fan-spread branches droop under the soft wreaths--droop\\nand press flatly to the trunk; presently the point of overloading\\nis reached, there is a soft sough and muffled dropping, the boughs\\nrecover, and the weighting goes on until the drifts have reached\\nthe midmost whorls and covered up the branches. When the snows\\nare particularly wet and heavy they spread over the young firs in\\ngreen-ribbed tents wherein harbor winter loving birds.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAll storms of desert hills, except wind storms, are impotent. East and\\neast of the Sierras they rise in nearly parallel ranges, desertward,\\nand no rain breaks over them, except from some far-strayed cloud\\nor roving wind from the California Gulf, and these only in winter.\\nIn summer the sky travails with thunderings and the flare of sheet\\nlightnings to win a few blistering big drops, and once in a lifetime\\nthe chance of a torrent. But you have not known what force resides in\\nthe mindless things until you have known a desert wind. One expects it\\nat the turn of the two seasons, wet and dry, with electrified tense\\nnerves. Along the edge of the mesa where it drops off to the valley,\\ndust devils begin to rise white and steady, fanning out at the top\\nlike the genii out of the Fisherman’s bottle. One supposes the Indians\\nmight have learned the use of smoke signals from these dust pillars as\\nthey learn most things direct from the tutelage of the earth. The air\\nbegins to move fluently, blowing hot and cold between the ranges. Far\\nsouth rises a murk of sand against the sky; it grows, the wind shakes\\nitself, and has a smell of earth. The cloud of small dust takes on the\\ncolor of gold and shuts out the neighborhood, the push of the wind is\\nunsparing. Only man of all folk is foolish enough to stir abroad in it.\\nBut being in a house is really much worse; no relief from the dust, and\\na great fear of the creaking timbers. There is no looking ahead in such\\na wind, and the bite of the small sharp sand on exposed skin is keener\\nthan any insect sting. One might sleep, for the lapping of the wind\\nwears one to the point of exhaustion very soon, but there is dread, in\\nopen sand stretches sometimes justified, of being over blown by the\\ndrift. It is hot, dry, fretful work, but by going along the ground with\\nthe wind behind, one may come upon strange things in its tumultuous\\nprivacy. I like these truces of wind and heat that the desert makes,\\notherwise I do not know how I should come by so many acquaintances with\\nfurtive folk. I like to see hawks sitting daunted in shallow holes, not\\ndaring to spread a feather, and doves in a row by the prickle bushes,\\nand shut-eyed cattle, turned tail to the wind in a patient doze. I like\\nthe smother of sand among the dunes, and finding small coiled snakes in\\nopen places, but I never like to come in a wind upon the silly sheep.\\nThe wind robs them of what wit they had, and they seem never to have\\nlearned the self-induced hypnotic stupor with which most wild things\\nendure weather stress. I have never heard that the desert winds brought\\nharm to any other than the wandering shepherds and their flocks. Once\\nbelow Pastaria Little Pete showed me bones sticking out of the sand\\nwhere a flock of two hundred had been smothered in a bygone wind. In\\nmany places the four-foot posts of a cattle fence had been buried by\\nthe wind-blown dunes.\\n\\nIt is enough occupation, when no storm is brewing, to watch the cloud\\ncurrents and the chambers of the sky. From Kearsarge, say, you look\\nover Inyo and find pink soft cloud masses asleep on the level desert\\nair; south of you hurries a white troop late to some gathering of their\\nkind at the back of Oppapago; nosing the foot of Waban, a woolly mist\\ncreeps south. In the clean, smooth paths of the middle sky and highest\\nup in air, drift, unshepherded, small flocks ranging contrarily.\\nYou will find the proper names of these things in the reports of\\nthe Weather Bureau--cirrus, cumulus, and the like--and charts that\\nwill teach by study when to sow and take up crops. It is astonishing\\nthe trouble men will be at to find out when to plant potatoes, and\\ngloze over the eternal meaning of the skies. You have to beat out for\\nyourself many mornings on the windly headlands the sense of the fact\\nthat you get the same rainbow in the cloud drift over Waban and the\\nspray of your garden hose. And not necessarily then do you live up to\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE LITTLE TOWN OF THE GRAPE VINES\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nThere are still some places in the west where the quails cry\\n“_cuidado_”; where all the speech is soft, all the manners gentle;\\nwhere all the dishes have _chile_ in them, and they make more of the\\nSixteenth of September than they do of the Fourth of July. I mean in\\nparticular El Pueblo de Las Uvas. Where it lies, how to come at it, you\\nwill not get from me; rather would I show you the heron’s nest in the\\ntulares. It has a peak behind it, glinting above the tamarack pines,\\nabove a breaker of ruddy hills that have a long slope valley-wards and\\nthe shoreward steep of waves toward the Sierras.\\n\\nBelow the Town of the Grape Vines, which shortens to Las Uvas\\nfor common use, the land dips away to the river pastures and the\\ntulares. It shrouds under a twilight thicket of vines, under a dome\\nof cottonwood-trees, drowsy and murmurous as a hive. Hereabouts are\\nsome strips of tillage and the headgates that dam up the creek for the\\nvillage weirs; upstream you catch the growl of the arrastra. Wild vines\\nthat begin among the willows lap over to the orchard rows, take the\\ntrellis and roof-tree.\\n\\nThere is another town above Las Uvas that merits some attention, a town\\nof arches and airy crofts, full of linnets, blackbirds, fruit birds,\\nsmall sharp hawks, and mockingbirds that sing by night. They pour out\\npiercing, unendurably sweet cavatinas above the fragrance of bloom and\\nmusky smell of fruit. Singing is in fact the business of the night\\nat Las Uvas as sleeping is for midday. When the moon comes over the\\nmountain wall new-washed from the sea, and the shadows lie like lace\\non the stamped floors of the patios, from recess to recess of the vine\\ntangle runs the thrum of guitars and the voice of singing.\\n\\nAt Las Uvas they keep up all the good customs brought out of Old Mexico\\nor bred in a lotus-eating land; drink, and are merry and look out for\\nsomething to eat afterward; have children, nine or ten to a family,\\nhave cock-fights, keep the siesta, smoke cigarettes and wait for the\\nsun to go down. And always they dance; at dusk on the smooth adobe\\nfloors, afternoons under the trellises where the earth is damp and has\\na fruity smell. A betrothal, a wedding, or a christening, or the mere\\nproximity of a guitar is sufficient occasion; and if the occasion\\nlacks, send for the guitar and dance anyway.\\n\\nAll this requires explanation. Antonio Sevadra, drifting this way from\\nOld Mexico with the flood that poured into the Tappan district after\\nthe first notable strike, discovered La Golondrina. It was a generous\\nlode and Tony a good fellow; to work it he brought in all the Sevadras,\\neven to the twice-removed; all the Castros who were his wife’s\\nfamily, all the Saises, Romeros, and Eschobars,--the relations of his\\nrelations-in-law. There you have the beginning of a pretty considerable\\ntown. To these accrued much of the Spanish California float swept out\\nof the southwest by eastern enterprise. They slacked away again when\\nthe price of silver went down, and the ore dwindled in La Golondrina.\\nAll the hot eddy of mining life swept away from that corner of the\\nhills, but there were always those too idle, too poor to move, or too\\neasily content with El Pueblo de Las Uvas.\\n\\nNobody comes nowadays to the town of the grape vines except, as we say,\\n“with the breath of crying,” but of these enough. All the low sills run\\nover with small heads. Ah, ah! There is a kind of pride in that if you\\ndid but know it, to have your baby every year or so as the time sets,\\nand keep a full breast. So great a blessing as marriage is easily come\\nby. It is told of Ruy Garcia that when he went for his marriage license\\nhe lacked a dollar of the clerk’s fee, but borrowed it of the sheriff,\\nwho expected reëlection and exhibited thereby a commendable thrift.\\n\\nOf what account is it to lack meal or meat when you may have it of\\nany neighbor? Besides, there is sometimes a point of honor in these\\nthings. Jesus Romero, father of ten, had a job sacking ore in the\\nMarionette which he gave up of his own accord. “Eh, why?” said Jesus,\\n“for my fam’ly.”\\n\\n“It is so, señora,” he said solemnly, “I go to the Marionette, I work,\\nI eat meat--pie--frijoles--good, ver’ good. I come home sad’day nigh’\\nI see my fam’ly. I play lil’ game poker with the boys, have lil’ drink\\nwine, my money all gone. My family have no money, nothing eat. All\\ntime I work at mine I eat, good, ver’ good grub. I think sorry for my\\nfam’ly. No, no, señora, I no work no more that Marionette, I stay with\\nmy fam’ly.” The wonder of it is, I think, that the family had the same\\npoint of view.\\n\\nEvery house in the town of the vines has its garden plot, corn and\\nbrown beans and a row of peppers reddening in the sun; and in damp\\nborders of the irrigating ditches clumps of _yerba santa_, horehound,\\ncatnip, and spikenard, wholesome herbs and curative, but if no peppers\\nthen nothing at all. You will have for a holiday dinner, in Las Uvas,\\nsoup with meat balls and chile in it, chicken with chile, rice with\\nchile, fried beans with more chile, enchilada, which is corn cake with\\na sauce of chile and tomatoes, onion, grated cheese, and olives, and\\nfor a relish chile _tepines_ passed about in a dish, all of which is\\ncomfortable and corrective to the stomach. You will have wine which\\nevery man makes for himself, of good body and inimitable bouquet, and\\nsweets that are not nearly so nice as they look.\\n\\nThere are two occasions when you may count on that kind of a meal;\\nalways on the Sixteenth of September, and on the two-yearly visits of\\nFather Shannon. It is absurd, of course, that El Pueblo de Las Uvas\\nshould have an Irish priest, but Black Rock, Minton, Jimville, and\\nall that country round do not find it so. Father Shannon visits them\\nall, waits by the Red Butte to confess the shepherds who go through\\nwith their flocks, carries blessing to small and isolated mines, and\\nso in the course of a year or so works around to Las Uvas to bury and\\nmarry and christen. Then all the little graves in the _Campo Santo_\\nare brave with tapers, the brown pine headboards blossom like Aaron’s\\nrod with paper roses and bright cheap prints of Our Lady of Sorrows.\\nThen the Señora Sevadra, who thinks herself elect of heaven for that\\noffice, gathers up the original sinners, the little Elijias, Lolas,\\nManuelitas, Josés, and Felipés, by dint of adjurations and sweets\\nsmuggled into small perspiring palms, to fit them for the Sacrament.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nI used to peek in at them, never so softly, in Doña Ina’s living-room;\\nRaphael-eyed little imps, going sidewise on their knees to rest them\\nfrom the bare floor, candles lit on the mantel to give a religious air,\\nand a great sheaf of wild bloom before the Holy Family. Come Sunday\\nthey set out the altar in the schoolhouse, with the finedrawn altar\\ncloths, the beaten silver candlesticks, and the wax images, chief glory\\nof Las Uvas, brought up mule-back from Old Mexico forty years ago. All\\nin white the communicants go up two and two in a hushed, sweet awe to\\ntake the body of their Lord, and Tomaso, who is priest’s boy, tries not\\nto look unduly puffed up by his office. After that you have dinner and\\na bottle of wine that ripened on the sunny slope of Escondito. All the\\nweek Father Shannon has shriven his people, who bring clean conscience\\nto the betterment of appetite, and the Father sets them an example.\\nFather Shannon is rather big about the middle to accommodate the large\\nlaugh that lives in him, but a most shrewd searcher of hearts. It is\\nreported that one derives comfort from his confessional, and I for my\\npart believe it.\\n\\nThe celebration of the Sixteenth, though it comes every year, takes\\nas long to prepare for as Holy Communion. The señoritas have each a\\nnew dress apiece, the señoras a new _rebosa_. The young gentlemen\\nhave new silver trimmings to their sombreros, unspeakable ties, silk\\nhandkerchiefs, and new leathers to their spurs. At this time when the\\npeppers glow in the gardens and the young quail cry “_cuidado_,”\\n“have a care!” you can hear the _plump, plump_ of the _metate_ from\\nthe alcoves of the vines where comfortable old dames, whose experience\\ngives them the touch of art, are pounding out corn for tamales.\\n\\nSchool-teachers from abroad have tried before now at Las Uvas to have\\nschool begin on the first of September, but got nothing else to stir in\\nthe heads of the little Castros, Garcias, and Romeros but feasts and\\ncock-fights until after the Sixteenth. Perhaps you need to be told that\\nthis is the anniversary of the Republic, when liberty awoke and cried\\nin the provinces of Old Mexico. You are aroused at midnight to hear\\nthem shouting in the streets, “_Vive la Libertad!_” answered from the\\nhouses and the recesses of the vines, “_Vive la Mexico!_” At sunrise\\nshots are fired commemorating the tragedy of unhappy Maximilian, and\\nthen music, the noblest of national hymns, as the great flag of Old\\nMexico floats up the flag-pole in the bare little plaza of shabby Las\\nUvas. The sun over Pine Mountain greets the eagle of Montezuma before\\nit touches the vineyards and the town, and the day begins with a\\ngreat shout. By and by there will be a reading of the Declaration of\\nIndependence and an address punctured by _vives_; all the town in its\\nbest dress, and some exhibits of horsemanship that make lathered bits\\nand bloodly spurs; also a cock-fight.\\n\\n[Illustration: BY NIGHT THERE WILL BE DANCING]\\n\\nBy night there will be dancing, and such music! old Santos to play the\\nflute, a little lean man with a saintly countenance, young Garcia whose\\nguitar has a soul, and Carrasco with the violin. They sit on a high\\nplatform above the dancers in the candle flare, backed by the red,\\nwhite, and green of Old Mexico, and play fervently such music as you\\nwill not hear otherwhere.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAt midnight the flag comes down. Count yourself at a loss if you are\\nnot moved by that performance. Pine Mountain watches whitely overhead,\\nshepherd fires glow strongly on the glooming hills. The plaza, the bare\\nglistening pole, the dark folk, the bright dresses, are lit ruddily by\\na bonfire. It leaps up to the eagle flag, dies down, the music begins\\nsoftly and aside. They play airs of old longing and exile; slowly out\\nof the dark the flag drops down, bellying and falling with the midnight\\ndraught. Sometimes a hymn is sung, always there are tears. The flag is\\ndown; Tony Sevadra has received it in his arms. The music strikes a\\nbarbaric swelling tune, another flag begins a slow ascent,--it takes a\\nbreath or two to realize that they are both, flag and tune, the Star\\nSpangled Banner,--a volley is fired, we are back, if you please, in\\nCalifornia of America. Every youth who has the blood of patriots in him\\nlays ahold on Tony Sevadra’s flag, happiest if he can get a corner of\\nit. The music goes before, the folk fall in two and two, singing. They\\nsing everything, America, the Marseillaise, for the sake of the French\\nshepherds hereabout, the hymn of Cuba, and the Chilian national air to\\ncomfort two families of that land. The flag goes to Doña Ina’s, with\\nthe candlesticks and the altar cloths, then Las Uvas eats tamales and\\ndances the sun up the slope of Pine Mountain.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nYou are not to suppose that they do not keep the Fourth, Washington’s\\nBirthday, and Thanksgiving at the town of the grape vines. These make\\nexcellent occasions for quitting work and dancing, but the Sixteenth\\nis the holiday of the heart. On Memorial Day the graves have garlands\\nand new pictures of the saints tacked to the headboards. There is\\ngreat virtue in an _Ave_ said in the Camp of the Saints. I like that\\nname which the Spanish speaking people give to the garden of the dead,\\n_Campo Santo_, as if it might be some bed of healing from which blind\\nsouls and sinners rise up whole and praising God. Sometimes the speech\\nof simple folk hints at truth the understanding does not reach. I am\\npersuaded only a complex soul can get any good of a plain religion.\\nYour earth-born is a poet and a symbolist. We breed in an environment\\nof asphalt pavements a body of people whose creeds are chiefly\\nrestrictions against other people’s way of life, and have kitchens and\\nlatrines under the same roof that houses their God. Such as these go\\nto church to be edified, but at Las Uvas they go for pure worship and\\nto entreat their God. The logical conclusion of the faith that every\\ngood gift cometh from God is the open hand and the finer courtesy. The\\nmeal done without buys a candle for the neighbor’s dead child. You do\\nfoolishly to suppose that the candle does no good.\\n\\nAt Las Uvas every house is a piece of earth--thick walled, whitewashed\\nadobe that keeps the even temperature of a cave; every man is an\\naccomplished horseman and consequently bow-legged; every family keeps\\ndogs, flea-bitten mongrels that loll on the earthen floors. They speak\\na purer Castilian than obtains in like villages of Mexico, and the\\nway they count relationship everybody is more or less akin. There is\\nnot much villainy among them. What incentive to thieving or killing\\ncan there be when there is little wealth and that to be had for the\\nborrowing! If they love too hotly, as we say “take their meat before\\ngrace,” so do their betters. Eh, what! shall a man be a saint before\\nhe is dead? And besides, Holy Church takes it out of you one way or\\nanother before all is done. Come away, you who are obsessed with your\\nown importance in the scheme of things, and have got nothing you did\\nnot sweat for, come away by the brown valleys and full-bosomed hills\\nto the even-breathing days, to the kindliness, earthiness, ease of El\\nPueblo de Las Uvas.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n  The Riverside Press\\n\\n  _Electrotyped and printed by H.\\xa0O.

OF THE CERISO\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nBy the end of the dry season the water trails of the Ceriso are worn\\nto a white ribbon in the leaning grass, spread out faint and fan wise\\ntoward the homes of gopher and ground rat and squirrel But however\\nfaint to man-sight, they are sufficiently plain to the furred and\\nfeathered folk who travel them Getting down to the eye level of rat\\nand squirrel kind, one perceives what might easily be wide and winding\\nroads to us if they occurred in thick plantations of trees three times\\nthe height of a man It needs but a slender thread of barrenness to\\nmake a mouse trail in the forest of the sod To the little people the\\nwater trails are as country roads, with scents as signboards\\n\\nIt seems that man-height is the least fortunate of all heights from\\nwhich to study trails It is better to go up the front of some tall\\nhill, say the spur of Black Mountain, looking back and down across the\\nhollow of the Ceriso Strange how long the soil keeps the impression\\nof any continuous treading, even after grass has overgrown it Twenty\\nyears since, a brief heyday of mining at Black Mountain made a stage\\nroad across the Ceriso, yet the parallel lines that are the wheel\\ntraces show from the height dark and well defined Afoot in the Ceriso\\none looks in vain for any sign of it So all the paths that wild\\ncreatures use going down to the Lone Tree Spring are mapped out whitely\\nfrom this level, which is also the level of the hawks\\n\\nThere is little water in the Ceriso at the best of times, and that\\nlittle brackish and smelling vilely, but by a lone juniper where\\nthe rim of the Ceriso breaks away to the lower country, there is a\\nperpetual rill of fresh sweet drink in the midst of lush grass and\\nwatercress In the dry season there is no water else for a man’s long\\njourney of a day East to the foot of Black Mountain, and north and\\nsouth without counting, are the burrows of small rodents, rat and\\nsquirrel kind Under the sage are the shallow forms of the jackrabbits,\\nand in the dry banks of washes, and among the strewn fragments of black\\nrock, lairs of bobcat, fox, and coyote\\n\\nThe coyote is your true water-witch, one who snuffs and paws, snuffs\\nand paws again at the smallest spot of moisture-scented earth until he\\nhas freed the blind water from the soil Many water-holes are no more\\nthan this detected by the lean hobo of the hills in localities where\\nnot even an Indian would look for it\\n\\nIt is the opinion of many wise and busy people that the hill-folk pass\\nthe ten-month interval between the end and renewal of winter rains,\\nwith no drink; but your true idler, with days and nights to spend\\nbeside the water trails, will not subscribe to it The trails begin,\\nas I said, very far back in the Ceriso, faintly, and converge in one\\nspan broad, white, hard-trodden way in the gully of the spring And why\\ntrails if there are no travelers in that direction?\\n\\nI have yet to find the land not scarred by the thin, far roadways of\\nrabbits and what not of furry folks that run in them Venture to look\\nfor some seldom-touched water-hole, and so long as the trails run with\\nyour general direction make sure you are right, but if they begin to\\ncross yours at never so slight an angle, to converge toward a point\\nleft or right of your objective, no matter what the maps say, or your\\nmemory, trust them; they _know_\\n\\nIt is very still in the Ceriso by day, so that were it not for the\\nevidence of those white beaten ways, it might be the desert it looks\\nThe sun is hot in the dry season, and the days are filled with the\\nglare of it Now and again some unseen coyote signals his pack in a\\nlong-drawn, dolorous whine that comes from no determinate point, but\\nnothing stirs much before mid-afternoon It is a sign when there begin\\nto be hawks skimming above the sage that the little people are going\\nabout their business\\n\\nWe have fallen on a very careless usage, speaking of wild creatures as\\nif they were bound by some such limitation as hampers clockwork When\\nwe say of one and another, they are night prowlers, it is perhaps true\\nonly as the things they feed upon are more easily come by in the dark,\\nand they know well how to adjust themselves to conditions wherein food\\nis more plentiful by day And their accustomed performance is very much\\na matter of keen eye, keener scent, quick ear, and a better memory of\\nsights and sounds than man dares boast Watch a coyote come out of his\\nlair and cast about in his mind where he will go for his daily killing\\nYou cannot very well tell what decides him, but very easily that he has\\ndecided He trots or breaks into short gallops, with very perceptible\\npauses to look up and about at landmarks, alters his tack a little,\\nlooking forward and back to steer his proper course I am persuaded\\nthat the coyotes in my valley, which is narrow and beset with steep,\\nsharp hills, in long passages steer by the pinnacles of the sky-line,\\ngoing with head cocked to one side to keep to the left or right of such\\nand such a promontory\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nI have trailed a coyote often, going across country, perhaps to where\\nsome slant-winged scavenger hanging in the air signaled prospect of\\na dinner, and found his track such as a man, a very intelligent man\\naccustomed to a hill country, and a little cautious, would make to\\nthe same point Here a detour to avoid a stretch of too little cover,\\nthere a pause on the rim of a gully to pick the better way,--and it is\\nusually the best way,--and making his point with the greatest economy\\nof effort Since the time of Seyavi the deer have shifted their feeding\\nground across the valley at the beginning of deep snows, by way of the\\nBlack Rock, fording the river at Charley’s Butte, and making straight\\nfor the mouth of the cañon that is the easiest going to the winter\\npastures on Waban So they still cross, though whatever trail they had\\nhas been long broken by ploughed ground; but from the mouth of Tinpah\\nCreek, where the deer come out of the Sierras, it is easily seen that\\nthe creek, the point of Black Rock, and Charley’s Butte are in line\\nwith the wide bulk of shade that is the foot of Waban Pass And along\\nwith this the deer have learned that Charley’s Butte is almost the only\\npossible ford, and all the shortest crossing of the valley It seems\\nthat the wild creatures have learned all that is important to their\\nway of life except the changes of the moon I have seen some prowling\\nfox or coyote, surprised by its sudden rising from behind the mountain\\nwall, slink in its increasing glow, watch it furtively from the cover\\nof near-by brush, unprepared and half uncertain of its identity until\\nit rode clear of the peaks, and finally make off with all the air of\\none caught napping by an ancient joke The moon in its wanderings\\nmust be a sort of exasperation to cunning beasts, likely to spoil by\\nuntimely risings some fore-planned mischief\\n\\nBut to take the trail again; the coyotes that are astir in the Ceriso\\nof late afternoons, harrying the rabbits from their shallow forms,\\nand the hawks that sweep and swing above them, are not there from\\nany mechanical promptings of instinct, but because they know of old\\nexperience that the small fry are about to take to seed gathering and\\nthe water trails The rabbits begin it, taking the trail with long,\\nlight leaps, one eye and ear cocked to the hills from whence a coyote\\nmight descend upon them at any moment Rabbits are a foolish people\\nThey do not fight except with their own kind, nor use their paws except\\nfor feet, and appear to have no reason for existence but to furnish\\nmeals for meat-eaters In flight they seem to rebound from the earth\\nof their own elasticity, but keep a sober pace going to the spring It\\nis the young watercress that tempts them and the pleasures of society,\\nfor they seldom drink Even in localities where there are flowing\\nstreams they seem to prefer the moisture that collects on herbage, and\\nafter rains may be seen rising on their haunches to drink delicately\\nthe clear drops caught in the tops of the young sage But drink they\\nmust, as I have often seen them mornings and evenings at the rill that\\ngoes by my door Wait long enough at the Lone Tree Spring and sooner or\\nlater they will all come in But here their matings are accomplished,\\nand though they are fearful of so little as a cloud shadow or blown\\nleaf, they contrive to have some playful hours At the spring the\\nbobcat drops down upon them from the black rock, and the red fox picks\\nthem up returning in the dark By day the hawk and eagle overshadow\\nthem, and the coyote has all times and seasons for his own\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nCattle, when there are any in the Ceriso, drink morning and evening,\\nspending the night on the warm last lighted slopes of neighboring\\nhills, stirring with the peep o’ day In these half wild spotted\\nsteers the habits of an earlier lineage persist It must be long since\\nthey have made beds for themselves, but before lying down they turn\\nthemselves round and round as dogs do They choose bare and stony\\nground, exposed fronts of westward facing hills, and lie down in\\ncompanies Usually by the end of the summer the cattle have been driven\\nor gone of their own choosing to the mountain meadows One year a\\nmaverick yearling, strayed or overlooked by the vaqueros, kept on until\\nthe season’s end, and so betrayed another visitor to the spring that\\nelse I might have missed On a certain morning the half-eaten carcass\\nlay at the foot of the black rock, and in moist earth by the rill of\\nthe spring, the foot-pads of a cougar, puma, mountain lion, or whatever\\nthe beast is rightly called The kill must have been made early in the\\nevening, for it appeared that the cougar had been twice to the spring;\\nand since the meat-eater drinks little until he has eaten, he must have\\nfed and drunk, and after an interval of lying up in the black rock, had\\neaten and drunk again There was no knowing how far he had come, but\\nif he came again the second night he found that the coyotes had left\\nhim very little of his kill\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nNobody ventures to say how infrequently and at what hour the small\\nfry visit the spring There are such numbers of them that if each\\ncame once between the last of spring and the first of winter rains,\\nthere would still be water trails I have seen badgers drinking about\\nthe hour when the light takes on the yellow tinge it has from coming\\nslantwise through the hills They find out shallow places, and are\\nloath to wet their feet Rats and chipmunks have been observed visiting\\nthe spring as late as nine o’clock mornings The larger spermophiles\\nthat live near the spring and keep awake to work all day, come and\\ngo at no particular hour, drinking sparingly At long intervals on\\nhalf-lighted days, meadow and field mice steal delicately along the\\ntrail These visitors are all too small to be watched carefully at\\nnight, but for evidence of their frequent coming there are the trails\\nthat may be traced miles out among the crisping grasses On rare\\nnights, in the places where no grass grows between the shrubs, and the\\nsand silvers whitely to the moon, one sees them whisking to and fro\\non innumerable errands of seed gathering, but the chief witnesses of\\ntheir presence near the spring are the elf owls Those burrow-haunting,\\nspeckled fluffs of greediness begin a twilight flitting toward the\\nspring, feeding as they go on grasshoppers, lizards, and small, swift\\ncreatures, diving into burrows to catch field mice asleep, battling\\nwith chipmunks at their own doors, and getting down in great numbers\\ntoward the lone juniper Now owls do not love water greatly on its own\\naccount Not to my knowledge have I caught one drinking or bathing,\\nthough on night wanderings across the mesa they flit up from under the\\nhorse’s feet along stream borders Their presence near the spring in\\ngreat numbers would indicate the presence of the things they feed upon\\nAll night the rustle and soft hooting keeps on in the neighborhood of\\nthe spring, with seldom small shrieks of mortal agony It is clear day\\nbefore they have all gotten back to their particular hummocks, and if\\none follows cautiously, not to frighten them into some near-by burrow,\\nit is possible to trail them far up the slope\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe crested quail that troop in the Ceriso are the happiest frequenters\\nof the water trails There is no furtiveness about their morning\\ndrink About the time the burrowers and all that feed upon them are\\naddressing themselves to sleep, great flocks pour down the trails with\\nthat peculiar melting motion of moving quail, twittering, shoving, and\\nshouldering They splatter into the shallows, drink daintily, shake out\\nsmall showers over their perfect coats, and melt away again into the\\nscrub, preening and pranking, with soft contented noises\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAfter the quail, sparrows and ground-inhabiting birds bathe with\\nthe utmost frankness and a great deal of splutter; and here in the\\nheart of noon hawks resort, sitting panting, with wings aslant, and a\\ntruce to all hostilities because of the heat One summer there came\\na road-runner up from the lower valley, peeking and prying, and he\\nhad never any patience with the water baths of the sparrows His own\\nablutions were performed in the clean, hopeful dust of the chaparral;\\nand whenever he happened on their morning splatterings, he would\\ndepress his glossy crest, slant his shining tail to the level of his\\nbody, until he looked most like some bright venomous snake, daunting\\nthem with shrill abuse and feint of battle Then suddenly he would go\\ntilting and balancing down the gully in fine disdain, only to return in\\na day or two to make sure the foolish bodies were still at it\\n\\n[Illustration: Fig 1]\\n\\nOut on the Ceriso about five miles, and wholly out of sight of it,\\nnear where the immemorial foot trail goes up from Saline Flat toward\\nBlack Mountain, is a water sign worth turning out of the trail to see\\nIt is a laid circle of stones large enough not to be disturbed by any\\nordinary hap, with an opening flanked by two parallel rows of similar\\nstones, between which were an arrow placed, touching the opposite rim\\nof the circle, thus (Fig 1), it would point as the crow flies to the\\nspring It is the old, indubitable water mark of the Shoshones One\\nstill finds it in the desert ranges in Salt Wells and Mesquite valleys,\\nand along the slopes of Waban On the other side of Ceriso, where the\\nblack rock begins, about a mile from the spring, is the work of an\\nolder, forgotten people The rock hereabout is all volcanic, fracturing\\nwith a crystalline whitish surface, but weathered outside to furnace\\nblackness Around the spring, where must have been a gathering place\\nof the tribes, it is scored over with strange pictures and symbols\\nthat have no meaning to the Indians of the present day; but out where\\nthe rock begins, there is carved into the white heart of it a pointing\\narrow over the symbol for distance and a circle full of wavy lines\\n(Fig 2) reading thus: “In this direction three [units of measurement\\nunknown] is a spring of sweet water; look for it”\\n\\n[Illustration: Fig

morning, sat solemnly\\nwhile the white tilted travelers’ vans lumbered down the Canada de los\\nUvas After three hours they had only clapped their wings, or exchanged\\nposts The season’s end in the vast dim valley of the San Joaquin is\\npalpitatingly hot, and the air breathes like cotton wool Through it\\nall the buzzards sit on the fences and low hummocks, with wings spread\\nfanwise for air There is no end to them, and they smell to heaven\\nTheir heads droop, and all their communication is a rare, horrid croak\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe increase of wild creatures is in proportion to the things they\\nfeed upon: the more carrion the more buzzards The end of the third\\nsuccessive dry year bred them beyond belief The first year quail\\nmated sparingly; the second year the wild oats matured no seed; the\\nthird, cattle died in their tracks with their heads towards the stopped\\nwatercourses And that year the scavengers were as black as the plague\\nall across the mesa and up the treeless, tumbled hills On clear days\\nthey betook themselves to the upper air, where they hung motionless for\\nhours That year there were vultures among them, distinguished by the\\nwhite patches under the wings All their offensiveness notwithstanding,\\nthey have a stately flight They must also have what pass for good\\nqualities among themselves, for they are social, not to say clannish\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt is a very squalid tragedy,--that of the dying brutes and the\\nscavenger birds Death by starvation is slow The heavy-headed,\\nrack-boned cattle totter in the fruitless trails; they stand for\\nlong, patient intervals; they lie down and do not rise There is\\nfear in their eyes when they are first stricken, but afterward only\\nintolerable weariness I suppose the dumb creatures know nearly as\\nmuch of death as do their betters, who have only the more imagination\\nTheir even-breathing submission after the first agony is their tribute\\nto its inevitableness It needs a nice discrimination to say which of\\nthe basket-ribbed cattle is likest to afford the next meal, but the\\nscavengers make few mistakes One stoops to the quarry and the flock\\nfollows\\n\\nCattle once down may be days in dying They stretch out their necks\\nalong the ground, and roll up their slow eyes at longer intervals The\\nbuzzards have all the time, and no beak is dropped or talon struck\\nuntil the breath is wholly passed It is doubtless the economy of\\nnature to have the scavengers by to clean up the carrion, but a wolf at\\nthe throat would be a shorter agony than the long stalking and sometime\\nperchings of these loathsome watchers Suppose now it were a man in\\nthis long-drawn, hungrily spied upon distress! When Timmie O’Shea was\\nlost on Armogossa Flats for three days without water, Long Tom Basset\\nfound him, not by any trail, but by making straight away for the points\\nwhere he saw buzzards stooping He could hear the beat of their wings,\\nTom said, and trod on their shadows, but O’Shea was past recalling what\\nhe thought about things after the second day My friend Ewan told\\nme, among other things, when he came back from San Juan Hill, that not\\nall the carnage of battle turned his bowels as the sight of slant black\\nwings rising flockwise before the burial squad\\n\\n[Illustration: LOST FOR THREE DAYS IN THE DESERT]\\n\\nThere are three kinds of noises buzzards make,--it is impossible to\\ncall them notes,--raucous and elemental There is a short croak of\\nalarm, and the same syllable in a modified tone to serve all the\\npurposes of ordinary conversation The old birds make a kind of throaty\\nchuckling to their young, but if they have any love song I have not\\nheard it The young yawp in the nest a little, with more breath than\\nnoise It is seldom one finds a buzzard’s nest, seldom that grown-ups\\nfind a nest of any sort;

the storm drift blew in and cut\\noff landmarks, the early dark obscured the rising drifts According to\\nthe Pocket Hunter’s account, he knew where he was, but couldn’t exactly\\nsay Three days before he had been in the west arm of Death Valley on\\na short water allowance, ankle deep in shifty sand; now he was on the\\nrise of Waban, knee-deep in sodden snow, and in both cases he did the\\nonly allowable thing--he walked on That is the only thing to do in a\\nsnowstorm in any case It might have been the creature instinct, which\\nin his way of life had room to grow, that led him to the cedar shelter;\\nat any rate he found it about four hours after dark, and heard the\\nheavy breathing of the flock He said that if he thought at all at this\\njuncture he must have thought that he had stumbled on a storm-belated\\nshepherd with his silly sheep; but in fact he took no note of anything\\nbut the warmth of packed fleeces, and snuggled in between them dead\\nwith sleep If the flock stirred in the night he stirred drowsily to\\nkeep close and let the storm go by That was all until morning woke him\\nshining on a white world Then the very soul of him shook to see the\\nwild sheep of God stand up about him, nodding their great horns beneath\\nthe cedar roof, looking out on the wonder of the snow They had moved a\\nlittle away from him with the coming of the light, but paid him no more\\nheed The light broadened and the white pavilions of the snow swam in\\nthe heavenly blueness of the sea from which they rose The cloud drift\\nscattered and broke billowing in the cañons The leader stamped lightly\\non the litter to put the flock in motion, suddenly they took the drifts\\nin those long light leaps that are nearest to flight, down and away\\non the slopes of Waban Think of that to happen to a Pocket Hunter!\\nBut though he had fallen on many a wished-for hap, he was curiously\\ninapt at getting the truth about beasts in general He believed in\\nthe venom of toads, and charms for snake bites, and--for this I could\\nnever forgive him--had all the miner’s prejudices against my friend the\\ncoyote Thief, sneak, and son of a thief were the friendliest words he\\nhad for this little gray dog of the wilderness\\n\\nOf course with so much seeking he came occasionally upon pockets of\\nmore or less value, otherwise he could not have kept up his way of\\nlife; but he had as much luck in missing great ledges as in finding\\nsmall ones He had been all over the Tonopah country, and brought away\\nfloat without happening upon anything that gave promise of what that\\ndistrict was to become in a few years He claimed to have chipped\\nbits off the very outcrop of the California Rand, without finding it\\nworth while to bring away, but none of these things put him out of\\ncountenance\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt was once in roving weather, when we found him shifting pack on a\\nsteep trail, that I observed certain of his belongings done up in green\\ncanvas bags, the veritable “green bag” of English novels It seemed\\nso incongruous a reminder in this untenanted West that I dropped\\ndown beside the trail overlooking the vast dim valley, to hear about\\nthe green canvas He had gotten it, he said, in London years before,\\nand that was the first I had known of his having been abroad It was\\nafter one of his “big strikes” that he had made the Grand Tour, and\\nhad brought nothing away from it but the green canvas bags, which he\\nconceived would fit his needs, and an ambition This last was nothing\\nless than to strike it rich and set himself up among the eminently\\nbourgeois of London It seemed that the situation of the wealthy\\nEnglish middle class, with just enough gentility above to aspire to,\\nand sufficient smaller fry to bully and patronize, appealed to his\\nimagination, though of course he did not put it so crudely as that\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt was no news to me then, two or three years after, to learn that he\\nhad taken ten thousand dollars from an abandoned claim, just the sort\\nof luck to have pleased him, and gone to London to spend it The land\\nseemed not to miss him any more than it had minded him, but I missed\\nhim and could not forget the trick of expecting him in least likely\\nsituations Therefore it was with a pricking sense of the familiar that\\nI followed a twilight trail of smoke, a year or two later, to the swale\\nof a dripping spring, and came upon a man by the fire with a coffee-pot\\nand frying-pan I was not surprised to find it was the Pocket Hunter\\nNo man can be stronger than his destiny\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHOSHONE LAND\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nIt is true I have been in Shoshone Land, but before that, long\\nbefore, I had seen it through the eyes of Winnenap´ in a rosy mist of\\nreminiscence, and must always see it with a sense of intimacy in the\\nlight that never was Sitting on the golden slope at the campoodie,\\nlooking across the Bitter Lake to the purple tops of Mutarango, the\\nmedicine-man drew up its happy places one by one, like little blessed\\nislands in a sea of talk For he was born a Shoshone, was Winnenap´;\\nand though his name, his wife, his children, and his tribal relations\\nwere of the Paiutes, his thoughts turned homesickly toward Shoshone\\nLand Once a Shoshone always a Shoshone Winnenap´ lived gingerly\\namong the Paiutes and in his heart despised them But he could speak\\na tolerable English when he would, and he always would if it were of\\nShoshone Land\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nHe had come into the keeping of the Paiutes as a hostage for the long\\npeace which the authority of the whites made interminable, and, though\\nthere was now no order in the tribe, nor any power that could have\\nlawfully restrained him, kept on in the old usage, to save his honor\\nand the word of his vanished kin He had seen his children’s children\\nin the borders of the Paiutes, but loved best his own miles of sand\\nand rainbow-painted hills Professedly he had not seen them since the\\nbeginning of his hostage;

Young Shoshones are like young quail, knowing\\nwithout teaching about feeding and hiding, and learning what civilized\\nchildren never learn, to be still and to keep on being still, at the\\nfirst hint of danger or strangeness\\n\\nAs for food, that appears to be chiefly a matter of being willing\\nDesert Indians all eat chuck-wallas, big black and white lizards that\\nhave delicate white flesh savored like chicken Both the Shoshones and\\nthe coyotes are fond of the flesh of _Gopherus agassizii_, the turtle\\nthat by feeding on buds, going without drink, and burrowing in the sand\\nthrough the winter, contrives to live a known period of twenty-five\\nyears It seems that most seeds are foodful in the arid regions, most\\nberries edible, and many shrubs good for firewood with the sap in\\nthem The mesquite bean, whether the screw or straight pod, pounded to\\na meal, boiled to a kind of mush, and dried in cakes, sulphur-colored\\nand needing an axe to cut it, is an excellent food for long journeys\\nFermented in water with wild honey and the honeycomb, it makes a\\npleasant, mildly intoxicating drink\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nNext to spring, the best time to visit Shoshone Land is when the\\ndeer-star hangs low and white like a torch over the morning hills Go\\nup past Winnedumah and down Saline and up again to the rim of Mesquite\\nValley Take no tent, but if you will, have an Indian build you a\\nwickiup, willows planted in a circle, drawn over to an arch, and bound\\ncunningly with withes, all the leaves on, and chinks to count the stars\\nthrough But there was never any but Winnenap´ who could tell and make\\nit worth telling about Shoshone Land\\n\\nAnd Winnenap´ will not any more He died, as do most medicine-men of\\nthe Paiutes\\n\\nWhere the lot falls when the campoodie chooses a medicine-man there\\nit rests It is an honor a man seldom seeks but must wear, an honor\\nwith a condition When three patients die under his ministrations, the\\nmedicine-man must yield his life and his office Wounds do not count;\\nbroken bones and bullet holes the Indian can understand, but measles,\\npneumonia, and smallpox are witchcraft Winnenap´ was medicine-man for\\nfifteen years Besides considerable skill in healing herbs, he used his\\nprerogatives cunningly It is permitted the medicine-man to decline the\\ncase when the patient has had treatment from any other, say the white\\ndoctor, whom many of the younger generation consult Or, if before\\nhaving seen the patient, he can definitely refer his disorder to some\\nsupernatural cause wholly out of the medicine-man’s jurisdiction, say\\nto the spite of an evil spirit going about in the form of a coyote,\\nand states the case convincingly, he may avoid the penalty But this\\nmust not be pushed too far All else failing, he can hide Winnenap´\\ndid this the time of the measles epidemic Returning from his yearly\\nherb gathering, he heard of it at Black Rock, and turning aside, he was\\nnot to be found, nor did he return to his own place until the disease\\nhad spent itself, and half the children of the campoodie were in their\\nshallow graves with beads sprinkled over them\\n\\nIt is possible the tale of Winnenap´’s patients had not been strictly\\nkept There had not been a medicine-man killed in the valley for twelve\\nyears, and for that the perpetrators had been severely punished by the\\nwhites The winter of the Big Snow an epidemic of pneumonia carried off\\nthe Indians with scarcely a warning;

and when the\\nwind blows there is occupation enough for the passengers, shifting\\nseats to hold down the windward side of the wagging coach This is\\na mere trifle The Jimville stage is built for five passengers, but\\nwhen you have seven, with four trunks, several parcels, three sacks\\nof grain, the mail and express, you begin to understand that proverb\\nabout the road which has been reported to you In time you learn to\\nengage the high seat beside the driver, where you get good air and the\\nbest company Beyond the desert rise the lava flats, scoriæ strewn;\\nsharp-cutting walls of narrow cañons; league-wide, frozen puddles of\\nblack rock, intolerable and forbidding Beyond the lava the mouths\\nthat spewed it out, ragged-lipped, ruined craters shouldering to the\\ncloud-line, mostly of red earth, as red as a red heifer These have\\nsome comforting of shrubs and grass You get the very spirit of the\\nmeaning of that country when you see Little Pete feeding his sheep\\nin the red, choked maw of an old vent,--a kind of silly pastoral\\ngentleness that glozes over an elemental violence Beyond the craters\\nrise worn, auriferous hills of a quiet sort, tumbled together;

in fact, he came into the Silver\\nDollar when we were holding a church fair and bought a pink silk\\npincushion I have often wondered what became of it Some of us shook\\nhands with him, not because we did not know, but because we had not\\nbeen officially notified, and there were those present who knew how\\nit was themselves When the sheriff arrived Wilkins had moved on, and\\nJimville organized a posse and brought him back, because the sheriff\\nwas a Jimville man and we had to stand by him\\n\\nI said we had the church fair at the Silver Dollar We had most things\\nthere, dances, town meetings, and the kinetoscope exhibition of the\\nPassion Play The Silver Dollar had been built when the borders of\\nJimville spread from Minton to the red hill the Defiance twisted\\nthrough “Side-Winder” Smith scrubbed the floor for us and moved the\\nbar to the back room The fair was designed for the support of the\\ncircuit rider who preached to the few that would hear, and buried us\\nall in turn He was the symbol of Jimville’s respectability, although\\nhe was of a sect that held dancing among the cardinal sins The\\nmanagement took no chances on offending the minister; at 1130 they\\ntendered him the receipts of the evening in the chairman’s hat, as a\\ndelicate intimation that the fair was closed The company filed out of\\nthe front door and around to the back Then the dance began formally\\nwith no feelings hurt These were the sort of courtesies, common enough\\nin Jimville, that brought tears of delicate inner laughter\\n\\nThere were others besides Mr Fanshawe who had walked out of Mr\\nHarte’s demesne to Jimville and wore names that smacked of the\\nsoil,--“Alkali Bill,” “Pike” Wilson, “Three Finger,” and “Mono Jim;”\\nfierce, shy, profane, sun-dried derelicts of the windy hills, who each\\nowned, or had owned, a mine and was wishful to own one again They\\nlaid up on the worn benches of the Silver Dollar or the Same Old Luck\\nlike beached vessels, and their talk ran on endlessly of “strike” and\\n“contact” and “mother lode,” and worked around to fights and hold-ups,\\nvillainy, haunts, and the hoodoo of the Minietta, told austerely\\nwithout imagination\\n\\nDo not suppose I am going to repeat it all; you who want these things\\nwritten up from the point of view of people who do not do them every\\nday would get no savor in their speech\\n\\nSays Three Finger, relating the history of the Mariposa, “I took it\\noff’n Tom Beatty, cheap, after his brother Bill was shot”\\n\\nSays Jim Jenkins, “What was the matter of him?”\\n\\n“Who? Bill? Abe Johnson shot him; he was fooling around Johnson’s wife,\\nan’ Tom sold me the mine dirt cheap”\\n\\n“Why didn’t he work it himself?”\\n\\n“Him? Oh, he was laying for Abe and calculated to have to leave the\\ncountry pretty quick”\\n\\n“Huh!” says Jim Jenkins, and the tale flows smoothly on\\n\\nYearly the spring fret floats the loose population of Jimville out\\ninto the desolate waste hot lands, guiding by the peaks and a few\\nrarely touched water-holes, always, always with the golden hope They\\ndevelop prospects and grow rich, develop others and grow poor but\\nnever embittered Say the hills, It is all one, there is gold enough,\\ntime enough, and men enough to come after you And at Jimville they\\nunderstand the language of the hills\\n\\nJimville does not know a great deal about the crust of the earth, it\\nprefers a “hunch” That is an intimation from the gods that if you go\\nover a brown back of the hills, by a dripping spring, up Coso way, you\\nwill find what is worth while I have never heard that the failure of\\nany particular hunch disproved the principle Somehow the rawness of\\nthe land favors the sense of personal relation to the supernatural\\nThere is not much intervention of crops, cities, clothes, and manners\\nbetween you and the organizing forces to cut off communication All\\nthis begets in Jimville a state that passes explanation unless you\\nwill accept an explanation that passes belief Along with killing\\nand drunkenness, coveting of women, charity, simplicity, there is\\na certain indifference, blankness, emptiness if you will, of all\\nvaporings, no bubbling of the pot,--it wants the German to coin a word\\nfor that,--no bread-envy, no brother-fervor Western writers have not\\nsensed it yet; they smack the savor of lawlessness too much upon their\\ntongues, but you have these to witness it is not mean-spiritedness It\\nis pure Greek in that it represents the courage to sheer off what is\\nnot worth while Beyond that it endures without sniveling, renounces\\nwithout self-pity, fears no death, rates itself not too great in the\\nscheme of things; so do beasts, so did St Jerome in the desert, so\\nalso in the elder day did gods Life, its performance, cessation, is no\\nnew thing to gape and wonder at\\n\\nHere you have the repose of the perfectly accepted instinct which\\nincludes passion and death in its perquisites I suppose that the end\\nof all our hammering and yawping will be something like the point of\\nview of Jimville The only difference will be in the decorations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMY NEIGHBOR’S FIELD\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nIt is one of those places God must have meant for a field from all\\ntime, lying very level at the foot of the slope that crowds up against\\nKearsarge, falling slightly toward the town North and south it is\\nfenced by low old glacial ridges, boulder strewn and untenable\\nEastward it butts on orchard closes and the village gardens, brimming\\nover into them by wild brier and creeping grass The village street,\\nwith its double row of unlike houses, breaks off abruptly at the edge\\nof the field in a footpath that goes up the streamside, beyond it, to\\nthe source of waters\\n\\nThe field is not greatly esteemed of the town, not being put to the\\nplough nor affording firewood, but breeding all manner of wild seeds\\nthat go down in the irrigating ditches to come up as weeds in the\\ngardens and grass plots But when I had no more than seen it in the\\ncharm of its spring smiling, I knew I should have no peace until I had\\nbought ground and built me a house beside it, with a little wicket to\\ngo in and out at all hours, as afterward came about\\n\\nEdswick, Roeder, Connor, and Ruffin owned the field before it fell to\\nmy neighbor But before that the Paiutes, mesne lords of the soil, made\\na campoodie by the rill of Pine Creek; and after, contesting the soil\\nwith them, cattle-men, who found its foodful pastures greatly to their\\nadvantage; and bands of blethering flocks shepherded by wild, hairy\\nmen of little speech, who attested their rights to the feeding ground\\nwith their long staves upon each other’s skulls Edswick homesteaded\\nthe field about the time the wild tide of mining life was roaring and\\nrioting up Kearsarge, and where the village now stands built a stone\\nhut, with loopholes to make good his claim against cattle-men or\\nIndians But Edswick died and Roeder became master of the field Roeder\\nowned cattle on a thousand hills, and made it a recruiting ground for\\nhis bellowing herds before beginning the long drive to market across a\\nshifty desert He kept the field fifteen years, and afterward falling\\ninto difficulties, put it out as security against certain sums Connor,\\nwho held the securities, was cleverer than Roeder and not so busy The\\nmoney fell due the winter of the Big Snow, when all the trails were\\nforty feet under drifts, and Roeder was away in San Francisco selling\\nhis cattle At the set time Connor took the law by the forelock and\\nwas adjudged possession of the field Eighteen days later Roeder\\narrived on snowshoes, both feet frozen, and the money in his pack In\\nthe long suit at law ensuing, the field fell to Ruffin, that clever\\none-armed lawyer with the tongue to wile a bird out of the bush,\\nConnor’s counsel, and was sold by him to my neighbor, whom from envying\\nhis possession I call Naboth\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nCuriously, all this human occupancy of greed and mischief left no mark\\non the field, but the Indians did, and the unthinking sheep Round its\\ncorners children pick up chipped arrow points of obsidian, scattered\\nthrough it are kitchen middens and pits of old sweat-houses By the\\nsouth corner, where the campoodie stood, is a single shrub of “hoopee”\\n(_Lycium Andersonii_), maintaining itself hardly among alien shrubs,\\nand near by, three low rakish trees of hackberry, so far from home that\\nno prying of mine has been able to find another in any cañon east or\\nwest But the berries of both were food for the Paiutes, eagerly sought\\nand traded for as far south as Shoshone Land By the fork of the creek\\nwhere the shepherds camp is a single clump of mesquite of the variety\\ncalled “screw bean” The seed must have shaken there from some sheep’s\\ncoat, for this is not the habitat of mesquite, and except for other\\nsingle shrubs at sheep camps, none grows freely for a hundred and fifty\\nmiles south or east\\n\\nNaboth has put a fence about the best of the field, but neither the\\nIndians nor the shepherds can quite forego it They make camp and build\\ntheir wattled huts about the borders of it, and no doubt they have\\nsome sense of home in its familiar aspect\\n\\nAs I have said, it is a low-lying field, between the mesa and the town,\\nwith no hillocks in it, but a gentle swale where the waste water of the\\ncreek goes down to certain farms, and the hackberry-trees, of which\\nthe tallest might be three times the height of a man, are the tallest\\nthings in it A mile up from the water gate that turns the creek into\\nsupply pipes for the town, begins a row of long-leaved pines, threading\\nthe watercourse to the foot of Kearsarge These are the pines that\\npuzzle the local botanist, not easily determined, and unrelated to\\nother conifers of the Sierra slope; the same pines of which the Indians\\nrelate a legend mixed of brotherliness and the retribution of God\\nOnce the pines possessed the field, as the worn stumps of them along\\nthe streamside show, and it would seem their secret purpose to regain\\ntheir old footing Now and then some seedling escapes the devastating\\nsheep a rod or two down-stream Since I came to live by the field\\none of these has tiptoed above the gully of the creek, beckoning the\\nprocession from the hills, as if in fact they would make back toward\\nthat skyward-pointing finger of granite on the opposite range, from\\nwhich, according to the legend, when they were bad Indians and it a\\ngreat chief, they ran away This year the summer floods brought the\\nround, brown, fruitful cones to my very door, and I look, if I live\\nlong enough, to see them come up greenly in my neighbor’s field\\n\\nIt is interesting to watch this retaking of old ground by the wild\\nplants, banished by human use Since Naboth drew his fence about the\\nfield and restricted it to a few wild-eyed steers, halting between the\\nhills and the shambles, many old habitués of the field have come back\\nto their haunts The willow and brown birch, long ago cut off by the\\nIndians for wattles, have come back to the streamside, slender and\\nvirginal in their spring greenness, and leaving long stretches of the\\nbrown water open to the sky In stony places where no grass grows,\\nwild olives sprawl; close-twigged, blue-gray patches in winter, more\\ntranslucent greenish gold in spring than any aureole Along with willow\\nand birch and brier, the clematis, that shyest plant of water borders,\\nslips down season by season to within a hundred yards of the village\\nstreet Convinced after three years that it would come no nearer, we\\nspent time fruitlessly pulling up roots to plant in the garden All\\nthis while, when no coaxing or care prevailed upon any transplanted\\nslip to grow, one was coming up silently outside the fence near the\\nwicket, coiling so secretly in the rabbit-brush that its presence was\\nnever suspected until it flowered delicately along its twining length\\nThe horehound comes through the fence and under it, shouldering the\\npickets off the railings; the brier rose mines under the horehound;\\nand no care, though I own I am not a close weeder, keeps the small\\npale moons of the primrose from rising to the night moth under my\\napple-trees The first summer in the new place, a clump of cypripediums\\ncame up by the irrigating ditch at the bottom of the lawn But the\\nclematis will not come inside, nor the wild almond\\n\\nI have forgotten to find out, though I meant to, whether the wild\\nalmond grew in that country where Moses kept the flocks of his\\nfather-in-law, but if so one can account for the burning bush It\\ncomes upon one with a flame-burst as of revelation; little hard red\\nbuds on leafless twigs, swelling unnoticeably, then one, two, or three\\nstrong suns, and from tip to tip one soft fiery glow, whispering with\\nbees as a singing flame A twig of finger size will be furred to the\\nthickness of one’s wrist by pink five-petaled bloom, so close that\\nonly the blunt-faced wild bees find their way in it In this latitude\\nlate frosts cut off the hope of fruit too often for the wild almond to\\nmultiply greatly, but the spiny, tap-rooted shrubs are resistant to\\nmost plant evils\\n\\nIt is not easy always to be attentive to the maturing of wild fruit\\nPlants are so unobtrusive in their material processes, and always at\\nthe significant moment some other bloom has reached its perfect hour\\nOne can never fix the precise moment when the rosy tint the field has\\nfrom the wild almond passes into the inspiring blue of lupines One\\nnotices here and there a spike of bloom, and a day later the whole\\nfield royal and ruffling lightly to the wind Part of the charm of\\nthe lupine is the continual stir of its plumes to airs not suspected\\notherwhere Go and stand by any crown of bloom and the tall stalks do\\nbut rock a little as for drowsiness, but look off across the field,\\nand on the stillest days there is always a trepidation in the purple\\npatches\\n\\nFrom midsummer until frost the prevailing note of the field is\\nclear gold, passing into the rusty tone of bigelovia going into a\\ndecline, a succession of color schemes more admirably managed than the\\ntransformation scene at the theatre Under my window a colony of cleome\\nmade a soft web of bloom that drew me every morning for a long still\\ntime; and one day I discovered that I was looking into a rare fretwork\\nof fawn and straw colored twigs from which both bloom and leaf had\\ngone, and I could not say if it had been for a matter of weeks or days\\nThe time to plant cucumbers and set out cabbages may be set down in the\\nalmanac, but never seed-time nor blossom in Naboth’s field\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nCertain winged and mailed denizens of the field seem to reach their\\nheyday along with the plants they most affect In June the leaning\\ntowers of the white milkweed are jeweled over with red and gold\\nbeetles, climbing dizzily This is that milkweed from whose stems\\nthe Indians flayed fibre to make snares for small game, but what\\nuse the beetles put it to except for a displaying ground for their\\ngay coats, I could never discover The white butterfly crop comes\\non with the bigelovia bloom, and on warm mornings makes an airy\\ntwinkling all across the field In September young linnets grow out\\nof the rabbit-brush in the night All the nests discoverable in\\nthe neighboring orchards will not account for the numbers of them\\nSomewhere, by the same secret process by which the field matures a\\nmillion more seeds than it needs, it is maturing red-hooded linnets\\nfor their devouring All the purlieus of bigelovia and artemisia are\\nnoisy with them for a month Suddenly as they come as suddenly go the\\nfly-by-nights, that pitch and toss on dusky barred wings above the\\nfield of summer twilights Never one of these nighthawks will you see\\nafter linnet time, though the hurtle of their wings makes a pleasant\\nsound across the dusk in their season\\n\\nFor two summers a great red-tailed hawk has visited the field every\\nafternoon between three and four o’clock, swooping and soaring with\\nthe airs of a gentleman adventurer What he finds there is chiefly\\nconjectured, so secretive are the little people of Naboth’s field Only\\nwhen leaves fall and the light is low and slant, one sees the long\\nclean flanks of the jackrabbits, leaping like small deer, and of late\\nafternoons little cotton-tails scamper in the runways But the most\\none sees of the burrowers, gophers, and mice is the fresh earthwork of\\ntheir newly opened doors, or the pitiful small shreds the butcher-bird\\nhangs on spiny shrubs\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt is a still field, this of my neighbor’s, though so busy, and\\nadmirably compounded for variety and pleasantness,--a little sand, a\\nlittle loam, a grassy plot, a stony rise or two, a full brown stream,\\na little touch of humanness, a footpath trodden out by moccasins\\nNaboth expects to make town lots of it and his fortune in one and the\\nsame day; but when I take the trail to talk with old Seyavi at the\\ncampoodie, it occurs to me that though the field may serve a good turn\\nin those days it will hardly be happier No, certainly not happier\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MESA TRAIL\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nThe mesa trail begins in the campoodie at the corner of Naboth’s field,\\nthough one may drop into it from the wood road toward the cañon, or\\nfrom any of the cattle paths that go up along the streamside; a clean,\\npale, smooth-trodden way between spiny shrubs, comfortably wide for a\\nhorse or an Indian It begins, I say, at the campoodie, and goes on\\ntoward the twilight hills and the borders of Shoshone Land It strikes\\ndiagonally across the foot of the hill-slope from the field until\\nit reaches the larkspur level, and holds south along the front of\\nOppapago, having the high ranges to the right and the foothills and the\\ngreat Bitter Lake below it on the left The mesa holds very level here,\\ncut across at intervals by the deep washes of dwindling streams, and\\nits treeless spaces uncramp the soul\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMesa trails were meant to be traveled on horseback, at the jigging\\ncoyote trot that only western-bred horses learn successfully A\\nfoot-pace carries one too slowly past the units in a decorative scheme\\nthat is on a scale with the country round for bigness It takes days’\\njourneys to give a note of variety to the country of the social\\nshrubs These chiefly clothe the benches and eastern foot-slopes of\\nthe Sierras,--great spreads of artemisia, _coleogyne_, and spinosa,\\nsuffering no other woody stemmed thing in their purlieus; this by\\nelection apparently, with no elbowing; and the several shrubs have each\\ntheir clientèle of flowering herbs It would be worth knowing how much\\nthe devastating sheep have had to do with driving the tender plants\\nto the shelter of the prickle bushes It might have begun earlier, in\\nthe time Seyavi of the campoodie tells of, when antelope ran on the\\nmesa like sheep for numbers, but scarcely any foot-high herb rears\\nitself except from the midst of some stout twigged shrub; larkspur in\\nthe _coleogyne_, and for every spinosa the purpling coils of phacelia\\nIn the shrub shelter, in the season, flock the little stemless things\\nwhose blossom time is as short as a marriage song The larkspurs make\\nthe best showing, being tall and sweet, swaying a little above the\\nshrubbery, scattering pollen dust which Navajo brides gather to fill\\ntheir marriage baskets This were an easier task than to find two of\\nthem of a shade Larkspurs in the botany are blue, but if you were to\\nslip rein to the stub of some black sage and set about proving it\\nyou would be still at it by the hour when the white gilias set their\\npale disks to the westering sun This is the gilia the children call\\n“evening snow,” and it is no use trying to improve on children’s names\\nfor wild flowers\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nFrom the height of a horse you look down to clean spaces in a shifty\\nyellow soil, bare to the eye as a newly sanded floor Then as soon as\\never the hill shadows begin to swell out from the sidelong ranges, come\\nlittle flakes of whiteness fluttering at the edge of the sand By dusk\\nthere are tiny drifts in the lee of every strong shrub, rosy-tipped\\ncorollas as riotous in the sliding mesa wind as if they were real\\nflakes shaken out of a cloud, not sprung from the ground on wiry\\nthree-inch stems They keep awake all night, and all the air is heavy\\nand musky sweet because of them\\n\\nFarther south on the trail there will be poppies meeting ankle deep,\\nand singly, peacock-painted bubbles of calochortus blown out at the\\ntops of tall stems But before the season is in tune for the gayer\\nblossoms the best display of color is in the lupin wash There is\\nalways a lupin wash somewhere on a mesa trail,--a broad, shallow,\\ncobble-paved sink of vanished waters, where the hummocks of _Lupinus\\nornatus_ run a delicate gamut from silvery green of spring to silvery\\nwhite of winter foliage They look in fullest leaf, except for color,\\nmost like the huddled huts of the campoodie, and the largest of them\\nmight be a man’s length in diameter In their season, which is after\\nthe gilias are at their best, and before the larkspurs are ripe for\\npollen gathering, every terminal whorl of the lupin sends up its\\nblossom stalk, not holding any constant blue, but paling and purpling\\nto guide the friendly bee to virginal honey sips, or away from the\\nperfected and depleted flower The length of the blossom stalk conforms\\nto the rounded contour of the plant, and of these there will be a\\nmillion moving indescribably in the airy current that flows down the\\nswale of the wash\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThere is always a little wind on the mesa, a sliding current of cooler\\nair going down the face of the mountain of its own momentum, but not to\\ndisturb the silence of great space Passing the wide mouths of cañons,\\none gets the effect of whatever is doing in them, openly or behind a\\nscreen of cloud,--thunder of falls, wind in the pine leaves, or rush\\nand roar of rain The rumor of tumult grows and dies in passing, as\\nfrom open doors gaping on a village street, but does not impinge on the\\neffect of solitariness In quiet weather mesa days have no parallel for\\nstillness, but the night silence breaks into certain mellow or poignant\\nnotes Late afternoons the burrowing owls may be seen blinking at the\\ndoors of their hummocks with perhaps four or five elfish nestlings\\narow, and by twilight begin a soft _whoo-oo-ing_, rounder, sweeter,\\nmore incessant in mating time It is not possible to disassociate\\nthe call of the burrowing owl from the late slant light of the mesa\\nIf the fine vibrations which are the golden-violet glow of spring\\ntwilights were to tremble into sound, it would be just that mellow\\ndouble note breaking along the blossom-tops While the glow holds one\\nsees the thistle-down flights and pouncings after prey, and on into\\nthe dark hears their soft _pus-ssh!_ clearing out of the trail ahead\\nMaybe the pin-point shriek of field mouse or kangaroo rat that pricks\\nthe wakeful pauses of the night is extorted by these mellow-voiced\\nplunderers, though it is just as like to be the work of the red fox on\\nhis twenty-mile constitutional\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nBoth the red fox and the coyote are free of the night hours, and both\\nkillers for the pure love of slaughter The fox is no great talker, but\\nthe coyote goes garrulously through the dark in twenty keys at once,\\ngossip, warning, and abuse They are light treaders, the split-feet,\\nso that the solitary camper sees their eyes about him in the dark\\nsometimes, and hears the soft intake of breath when no leaf has\\nstirred and no twig snapped underfoot The coyote is your real lord\\nof the mesa, and so he makes sure you are armed with no long black\\ninstrument to spit your teeth into his vitals at a thousand yards, is\\nboth bold and curious Not so bold, however, as the badger and not so\\nmuch of a curmudgeon This shortlegged meat-eater loves half lights and\\nlowering days, has no friends, no enemies, and disowns his offspring\\nVery likely if he knew how hawk and crow dog him for dinners, he would\\nresent it But the badger is not very well contrived for looking up\\nor far to either side Dull afternoons he may be met nosing a trail\\nhot-foot to the home of ground rat or squirrel, and is with difficulty\\npersuaded to give the right of way The badger is a pot-hunter and no\\nsportsman Once at the hill, he dives for the central chamber, his\\nsharp-clawed, splayey feet splashing up the sand like a bather in the\\nsurf He is a swift trailer, but not so swift or secretive but some\\nsmall sailing hawk or lazy crow, perhaps one or two of each, has spied\\nupon him and come drifting down the wind to the killing\\n\\nNo burrower is so unwise as not to have several exits from his dwelling\\nunder protecting shrubs When the badger goes down, as many of the\\nfurry people as are not caught napping come up by the back doors, and\\nthe hawks make short work of them I suspect that the crows get nothing\\nbut the gratification of curiosity and the pickings of some secret\\nstore of seeds unearthed by the badger Once the excavation begins they\\nwalk about expectantly, but the little gray hawks beat slow circles\\nabout the doors of exit, and are wiser in their generation, though they\\ndo not look it\\n\\nThere are always solitary hawks sailing above the mesa, and where some\\nblue tower of silence lifts out of the neighboring range, an eagle\\nhanging dizzily, and always buzzards high up in the thin, translucent\\nair making a merry-go-round Between the coyote and the birds of\\ncarrion the mesa is kept clear of miserable dead\\n\\nThe wind, too, is a besom over the treeless spaces, whisking new sand\\nover the litter of the scant-leaved shrubs, and the little doorways\\nof the burrowers are as trim as city fronts It takes man to leave\\nunsightly scars on the face of the earth Here on the mesa the\\nabandoned campoodies of the Paiutes are spots of desolation long after\\nthe wattles of the huts have warped in the brush heaps The campoodies\\nare near the watercourses, but never in the swale of the stream The\\nPaiute seeks rising ground, depending on air and sun for purification\\nof his dwelling, and when it becomes wholly untenable, moves\\n\\nA campoodie at noontime, when there is no smoke rising and no stir of\\nlife, resembles nothing so much as a collection of prodigious wasps’\\nnests The huts are squat and brown and chimneyless, facing east, and\\nthe inhabitants have the faculty of quail for making themselves scarce\\nin the underbrush at the approach of strangers But they are really\\nnot often at home during midday, only the blind and incompetent left\\nto keep the camp These are working hours, and all across the mesa\\none sees the women whisking seeds of _chia_ into their spoon-shaped\\nbaskets, these emptied again into the huge conical carriers, supported\\non the shoulders by a leather band about the forehead\\n\\nMornings and late afternoons one meets the men singly and afoot on\\nunguessable errands, or riding shaggy, browbeaten ponies, with game\\nslung across the saddle-bows This might be deer or even antelope,\\nrabbits, or, very far south towards Shoshone Land, lizards\\n\\nThere are myriads of lizards on the mesa, little gray darts, or larger\\nsalmon-sided ones that may be found swallowing their skins in the\\nsafety of a prickle-bush in early spring Now and then a palm’s breadth\\nof the trail gathers itself together and scurries off with a little\\nrustle under the brush, to resolve itself into sand again This is pure\\nwitchcraft If you succeed in catching it in transit, it loses its\\npower and becomes a flat, horned, toad-like creature, horrid looking\\nand harmless, of the color of the soil; and the curio dealer will give\\nyou two bits for it, to stuff\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMen have their season on the mesa as much as plants and four-footed\\nthings, and one is not like to meet them out of their time For\\nexample, at the time of _rodeos_, which is perhaps April, one meets\\nfree riding vaqueros who need no trails and can find cattle where to\\nthe layman no cattle exist As early as February bands of sheep work up\\nfrom the south to the high Sierra pastures It appears that shepherds\\nhave not changed more than sheep in the process of time The shy hairy\\nmen who herd the tractile flocks might be, except for some added\\nclothing, the very brethren of David Of necessity they are hardy,\\nsimple livers, superstitious, fearful, given to seeing visions, and\\nalmost without speech It needs the bustle of shearings and copious\\nlibations of sour, weak wine to restore the human faculty Petite Pete,\\nwho works a circuit up from the Ceriso to Red Butte and around by way\\nof Salt Flats, passes year by year on the mesa trail, his thick hairy\\nchest thrown open to all weathers, twirling his long staff, and dealing\\nbrotherly with his dogs, who are possibly as intelligent, certainly\\nhandsomer\\n\\nA flock’s journey is seven miles, ten if pasture fails, in a windless\\nblur of dust, feeding as it goes, and resting at noons Such hours Pete\\nweaves a little screen of twigs between his head and the sun--the rest\\nof him is as impervious as one of his own sheep--and sleeps while his\\ndogs have the flocks upon their consciences At night, wherever he may\\nbe, there Pete camps, and fortunate the trail-weary traveler who falls\\nin with him When the fire kindles and savory meat seethes in the pot,\\nwhen there is a drowsy blether from the flock, and far down the mesa\\nthe twilight twinkle of shepherd fires, when there is a hint of blossom\\nunderfoot and a heavenly whiteness on the hills, one harks back without\\neffort to Judæa and the Nativity But one feels by day anything but\\ngood will to note the shorn shrubs and cropped blossom-tops So many\\nseasons’ effort, so many suns and rains to make a pound of wool! And\\nthen there is the loss of ground-inhabiting birds that must fail from\\nthe mesa when few herbs ripen seed\\n\\nOut West, the west of the mesas and the unpatented hills, there is more\\nsky than any place in the world It does not sit flatly on the rim of\\nearth, but begins somewhere out in the space in which the earth is\\npoised, hollows more, and is full of clean winey winds There are some\\nodors, too, that get into the blood There is the spring smell of sage\\nthat is the warning that sap is beginning to work in a soil that looks\\nto have none of the juices of life in it; it is the sort of smell that\\nsets one thinking what a long furrow the plough would turn up here,\\nthe sort of smell that is the beginning of new leafage, is best at the\\nplant’s best, and leaves a pungent trail where wild cattle crop There\\nis the smell of sage at sundown, burning sage from campoodies and sheep\\ncamps, that travels on the thin blue wraiths of smoke; the kind of\\nsmell that gets into the hair and garments, is not much liked except\\nupon long acquaintance, and every Paiute and shepherd smells of it\\nindubitably There is the palpable smell of the bitter dust that comes\\nup from the alkali flats at the end of the dry seasons, and the smell\\nof rain from the wide-mouthed cañons And last the smell of the salt\\ngrass country, which is the beginning of other things that are the end\\nof the mesa trail\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BASKET MAKER\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n“A man,” says Seyavi of the campoodie, “must have a woman, but a woman\\nwho has a child will do very well”\\n\\nThat was perhaps why, when she lost her mate in the dying struggle of\\nhis race, she never took another, but set her wit to fend for herself\\nand her young son No doubt she was often put to it in the beginning to\\nfind food for them both The Paiutes had made their last stand at the\\nborder of the Bitter Lake; battle-driven they died in its waters, and\\nthe land filled with cattle-men and adventurers for gold: this while\\nSeyavi and the boy lay up in the caverns of the Black Rock and ate tule\\nroots and fresh-water clams that they dug out of the slough bottoms\\nwith their toes In the interim, while the tribes swallowed their\\ndefeat, and before the rumor of war died out, they must have come very\\nnear to the bare core of things That was the time Seyavi learned the\\nsufficiency of mother wit, and how much more easily one can do without\\na man than might at first be supposed\\n\\nTo understand the fashion of any life, one must know the land it is\\nlived in and the procession of the year This valley is a narrow one, a\\nmere trough between hills, a draught for storms, hardly a crow’s flight\\nfrom the sharp Sierras of the Snows to the curled, red and ochre,\\nuncomforted, bare ribs of Waban Midway of the groove runs a burrowing,\\ndull river, nearly a hundred miles from where it cuts the lava flats\\nof the north to its widening in a thick, tideless pool of a lake\\nHereabouts the ranges have no foothills, but rise up steeply from the\\nbench lands above the river Down from the Sierras, for the east ranges\\nhave almost no rain, pour glancing white floods toward the lowest land,\\nand all beside them lie the campoodies, brown wattled brush heaps,\\nlooking east\\n\\nIn the river are mussels, and reeds that have edible white roots, and\\nin the soddy meadows tubers of joint grass; all these at their best\\nin the spring On the slope the summer growth affords seeds; up the\\nsteep the one-leafed pines, an oily nut That was really all they could\\ndepend upon, and that only at the mercy of the little gods of frost\\nand rain For the rest it was cunning against cunning, caution against\\nskill, against quacking hordes of wild-fowl in the tulares, against\\npronghorn and bighorn and deer You can guess, however, that all this\\nwarring of rifles and bowstrings, this influx of overlording whites,\\nhad made game wilder and hunters fearful of being hunted You can\\nsurmise also, for it was a crude time and the land was raw, that the\\nwomen became in turn the game of the conquerors\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThere used to be in the Little Antelope a she dog, stray or outcast,\\nthat had a litter in some forsaken lair, and ranged and foraged\\nfor them, slinking savage and afraid, remembering and mistrusting\\nhumankind, wistful, lean, and sufficient for her young I have thought\\nSeyavi might have had days like that, and have had perfect leave to\\nthink, since she will not talk of it Paiutes have the art of reducing\\nlife to its lowest ebb and yet saving it alive on grasshoppers,\\nlizards, and strange herbs; and that time must have left no shift\\nuntried It lasted long enough for Seyavi to have evolved the\\nphilosophy of life which I have set down at the beginning She had gone\\nbeyond learning to do for her son, and learned to believe it worth\\nwhile\\n\\nIn our kind of society, when a woman ceases to alter the fashion of her\\nhair, you guess that she has passed the crisis of her experience If\\nshe goes on crimping and uncrimping with the changing mode, it is safe\\nto suppose she has never come up against anything too big for her The\\nIndian woman gets nearly the same personal note in the pattern of her\\nbaskets Not that she does not make all kinds, carriers, water-bottles,\\nand cradles,--these are kitchen ware,--but her works of art are all of\\nthe same piece Seyavi made flaring, flat-bottomed bowls, cooking pots\\nreally, when cooking was done by dropping hot stones into water-tight\\nfood baskets, and for decoration a design in colored bark of the\\nprocession of plumed crests of the valley quail In this pattern she\\nhad made cooking pots in the golden spring of her wedding year, when\\nthe quail went up two and two to their resting places about the foot\\nof Oppapago In this fashion she made them when, after pillage, it\\nwas possible to reinstate the housewifely crafts Quail ran then in\\nthe Black Rock by hundreds,--so you will still find them in fortunate\\nyears,--and in the famine time the women cut their long hair to make\\nsnares when the flocks came morning and evening to the springs\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nSeyavi made baskets for love and sold them for money, in a generation\\nthat preferred iron pots for utility Every Indian woman is an\\nartist,--sees, feels, creates, but does not philosophize about her\\nprocesses Seyavi’s bowls are wonders of technical precision, inside\\nand out, the palm finds no fault with them, but the subtlest appeal is\\nin the sense that warns us of humanness in the way the design spreads\\ninto the flare of the bowl There used to be an Indian woman at Olancha\\nwho made bottle-neck trinket baskets in the rattlesnake pattern, and\\ncould accommodate the design to the swelling bowl and flat shoulder of\\nthe basket without sensible disproportion, and so cleverly that you\\nmight own one a year without thinking how it was done; but Seyavi’s\\nbaskets had a touch beyond cleverness The weaver and the warp lived\\nnext to the earth and were saturated with the same elements Twice a\\nyear, in the time of white butterflies and again when young quail ran\\nneck and neck in the chaparral, Seyavi cut willows for basketry by\\nthe creek where it wound toward the river against the sun and sucking\\nwinds It never quite reached the river except in far-between times\\nof summer flood, but it always tried, and the willows encouraged it\\nas much as they could You nearly always found them a little farther\\ndown than the trickle of eager water The Paiute fashion of counting\\ntime appeals to me more than any other calendar They have no stamp of\\nheathen gods nor great ones, nor any succession of moons as have red\\nmen of the East and North, but count forward and back by the progress\\nof the season; the time of _taboose_, before the trout begin to leap,\\nthe end of the piñon harvest, about the beginning of deep snows So\\nthey get nearer the sense of the season, which runs early or late\\naccording as the rains are forward or delayed But whenever Seyavi\\ncut willows for baskets was always a golden time, and the soul of the\\nweather went into the wood If you had ever owned one of Seyavi’s\\ngolden russet cooking bowls with the pattern of plumed quail, you would\\nunderstand all this without saying anything\\n\\nBefore Seyavi made baskets for the satisfaction of desire,--for that is\\na house-bred theory of art that makes anything more of it,--she danced\\nand dressed her hair In those days, when the spring was at flood and\\nthe blood pricked to the mating fever, the maids chose their flowers,\\nwreathed themselves, and danced in the twilights, young desire crying\\nout to young desire They sang what the heart prompted, what the flower\\nexpressed, what boded in the mating weather\\n\\n“And what flower did you wear, Seyavi?”\\n\\n“I, ah,--the white flower of twining (clematis), on my body and my\\nhair, and so I sang:--\\n\\n    “I am the white flower of twining,\\n    Little white flower by the river,\\n    Oh, flower that twines close by the river;\\n    Oh, trembling flower!\\n    So trembles the maiden heart”\\n\\nSo sang Seyavi of the campoodie before she made baskets, and in her\\nlater days laid her arms upon her knees and laughed in them at the\\nrecollection But it was not often she would say so much, never\\nunderstanding the keen hunger I had for bits of lore and the “fool\\ntalk” of her people She had fed her young son with meadowlarks’\\ntongues, to make him quick of speech; but in late years was loath to\\nadmit it, though she had come through the period of unfaith in the lore\\nof the clan with a fine appreciation of its beauty and significance\\n\\n“What good will your dead get, Seyavi, of the baskets you burn?” said\\nI, coveting them for my own collection\\n\\nThus Seyavi, “As much good as yours of the flowers you strew”\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nOppapago looks on Waban, and Waban on Coso and the Bitter Lake, and\\nthe campoodie looks on these three; and more, it sees the beginning\\nof winds along the foot of Coso, the gathering of clouds behind the\\nhigh ridges, the spring flush, the soft spread of wild almond bloom\\non the mesa These first, you understand, are the Paiute’s walls, the\\nother his furnishings Not the wattled hut is his home, but the land,\\nthe winds, the hill front, the stream These he cannot duplicate at\\nany furbisher’s shop as you who live within doors, who, if your purse\\nallows, may have the same home at Sitka and Samarcand So you see how\\nit is that the homesickness of an Indian is often unto death, since he\\ngets no relief from it; neither wind nor weed nor sky-line, nor any\\naspect of the hills of a strange land sufficiently like his own So it\\nwas when the government reached out for the Paiutes, they gathered into\\nthe Northern Reservation only such poor tribes as could devise no other\\nend of their affairs Here, all along the river, and south to Shoshone\\nLand, live the clans who owned the earth, fallen into the deplorable\\ncondition of hangers-on Yet you hear them laughing at the hour when\\nthey draw in to the campoodie after labor, when there is a smell of\\nmeat and the steam of the cooking pots goes up against the sun Then\\nthe children lie with their toes in the ashes to hear tales; then they\\nare merry, and have the joys of repletion and the nearness of their\\nkind They have their hills, and though jostled are sufficiently free\\nto get some fortitude for what will come For now you shall hear of the\\nend of the basket maker\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIn her best days Seyavi was most like Deborah, deep bosomed, broad in\\nthe hips, quick in counsel, slow of speech, esteemed of her people\\nThis was that Seyavi who reared a man by her own hand, her own wit,\\nand none other When the townspeople began to take note of her--and it\\nwas some years after the war before there began to be any towns--she\\nwas then in the quick maturity of primitive women; but when I knew her\\nshe seemed already old Indian women do not often live to great age,\\nthough they look incredibly steeped in years They have the wit to win\\nsustenance from the raw material of life without intervention, but\\nthey have not the sleek look of the women whom the social organization\\nconspires to nourish Seyavi had somehow squeezed out of her daily\\nround a spiritual ichor that kept the skill in her knotted fingers\\nlong after the accustomed time, but that also failed By all counts\\nshe would have been about sixty years old when it came her turn to sit\\nin the dust on the sunny side of the wickiup, with little strength\\nleft for anything but looking And in time she paid the toll of the\\nsmoky huts and became blind This is a thing so long expected by the\\nPaiutes that when it comes they find it neither bitter nor sweet, but\\ntolerable because common There were three other blind women in the\\ncampoodie, withered fruit on a bough, but they had memory and speech\\nBy noon of the sun there were never any left in the campoodie but\\nthese or some mother of weanlings, and they sat to keep the ashes warm\\nupon the hearth If it were cold, they burrowed in the blankets of the\\nhut; if it were warm, they followed the shadow of the wickiup around\\nStir much out of their places they hardly dared, since one might not\\nhelp another; but they called, in high, old cracked voices, gossip and\\nreminder across the ash heaps\\n\\nThen, if they have your speech or you theirs, and have an hour to\\nspare, there are things to be learned of life not set down in any\\nbooks, folk tales, famine tales, love and long-suffering and desire,\\nbut no whimpering Now and then one or another of the blind keepers\\nof the camp will come across to where you sit gossiping, tapping her\\nway among the kitchen middens, guided by your voice that carries far in\\nthe clearness and stillness of mesa afternoons But suppose you find\\nSeyavi retired into the privacy of her blanket, you will get nothing\\nfor that day There is no other privacy possible in a campoodie All\\nthe processes of life are carried on out of doors or behind the thin,\\ntwig-woven walls of the wickiup, and laughter is the only corrective\\nfor behavior Very early the Indian learns to possess his countenance\\nin impassivity, to cover his head with his blanket Something to wrap\\naround him is as necessary to the Paiute as to you your closet to pray\\nin\\n\\nSo in her blanket Seyavi, sometime basket maker, sits by the unlit\\nhearths of her tribe and digests her life, nourishing her spirit\\nagainst the time of the spirit’s need, for she knows in fact quite as\\nmuch of these matters as you who have a larger hope, though she has\\nnone but the certainty that having borne herself courageously to this\\nend she will not be reborn a coyote\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE STREETS OF THE MOUNTAINS\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nAll streets of the mountains lead to the citadel; steep or slow they go\\nup to the core of the hills Any trail that goes otherwhere must dip\\nand cross, sidle and take chances Rifts of the hills open into each\\nother, and the high meadows are often wide enough to be called valleys\\nby courtesy;

up open swales of dribbling\\nsprings; swarm over old moraines; circle the peaty swamps and part\\nand meet about clean still lakes; scale the stony gullies; tormented,\\nbowed, persisting to the door of the storm chambers, tall priests to\\npray for rain The spring winds lift clouds of pollen dust, finer than\\nfrankincense, and trail it out over high altars, staining the snow No\\ndoubt they understand this work better than we;

depend upon them for when found they are often brackish and\\nunwholesome or maddening slow dribbles in a thirsty soil here you\\nfind the hot sink of death valley or high rolling districts

at the rill that\\ngoes by my door wait long enough at the lone tree spring and sooner or\\nlater they will all come in but here their matings are accomplished\\nand though they are fearful of so little as a cloud shadow or blown\\nleaf they contrive to have some playful hours at the spring the\\nbobcat drops down upon them from the black rock and the red fox picks\\nthem up returning in the

appeared that the cougar had been twice to the spring\\nand since the meateater drinks little until he has eaten he must have\\nfed and drunk and after an interval of lying up in the black rock had\\neaten and drunk again there was no knowing how far he had come but\\nif he came again the second night he found that the coyotes had left\\nhim very little of his kill\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nnobody ventures to say how infrequently and at what hour the small\\nfry visit the spring there are such numbers of them that if each\\ncame once between the last of spring

than\\nnoise it is seldom one finds a buzzard’s nest seldom that grownups\\nfind a nest of any sort it is only children to whom these things\\nhappen by right but by making a business of it one may come upon\\nthem in wide quiet cañons or on the lookouts of lonely tabletopped\\nmountains three or four together in the tops of stubby trees or on\\nrotten cliffs well open to the sky\\n\\nit is probable that the buzzard is gregarious but it seems unlikely\\nfrom the small number of young noted at any time that every female\\nincubates each year the young birds are easily distinguished by their\\nsize when feeding and high up in air by the worn primaries of the\\nolder birds it is when the young go out of the nest on their first\\nforaging that the parents full of a crass and simple pride make their\\nindescribable chucklings of gobbling gluttonous delight the little\\nones would be amusing as they tug and tussle if one could forget what\\nit is they feed upon\\n\\none never comes any nearer to the vulture’s nest or nestlings than\\nhearsay they keep to the southerly sierras and are bold enough it\\nseems to do killing on their own account when no carrion is at

unmistakable\\nodor of burning sage it is a smell that carries far and indicates\\nusually the nearness of a campoodie but on the level mesa nothing\\ntaller showed than diana’s sage over the tops of it beginning to dusk\\nunder a young white moon trailed a wavering ghost of smoke and at\\nthe end of it i came upon the pocket hunter making a dry camp in the\\nfriendly scrub he sat tailorwise in the sand with his coffeepot on\\nthe coals his supper ready to hand in the fryingpan and himself in\\na mood for talk his pack burros in hobbles strayed off to hunt for a\\nwetter mouthful than the sage afforded and gave him no concern\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nwe came upon him often after that threading the windy passes or by\\nwaterholes in the desert hills and got to know much of his way of\\nlife he was a small bowed man with a face and manner and speech of\\nno character at all as if he had that faculty of small hunted things\\nof taking on the protective color of his surroundings his clothes were\\nof no fashion that i could remember except that they bore liberal\\nmarkings of pot black and he had a curious fashion of going about\\nwith his mouth open which gave him a vacant look until you came near\\nenough to perceive him busy about an endless hummed wordless tune\\nhe traveled far and took a long time to it but the simplicity of his\\nkitchen arrangements was elemental a pot for beans a coffeepot a\\nfryingpan a tin to mix bread inhe fed the burros in this when there\\nwas needwith these he had been half round our western world and back\\nhe explained to me very early in our acquaintance what was good to take\\nto the hills for food nothing sticky for that “dirtied the pots”\\nnothing with “juice” to it for that would not pack to advantage and\\nnothing likely to ferment he used no gun but he would set snares\\nby the waterholes for quail and doves and in the trout country he\\ncarried a line burros he kept one or two according to his pack for\\nthis chief excellence that they would eat potato parings and firewood\\nhe had owned a horse in the foothill country but when he came to\\nthe desert with no forage but mesquite he found himself under the\\nnecessity of picking the beans from the briers a labor that drove him\\nto the use of pack animals to whom thorns were a relish\\n\\ni suppose no man becomes a pocket hunter by first intention he must be\\nborn with the faculty and along comes the occasion like the tap on\\nthe test tube that induces crystallization my friend had been several\\nthings of no moment until he struck a thousanddollar pocket in the\\nlee district and came into his vocation a pocket you must know is\\na small body of rich ore occurring by itself or in a vein of poorer\\nstuff nearly every mineral ledge contains such if only one has the\\nluck to hit upon them without too much labor the sensible thing for a\\nman to do who has found a good pocket is to buy himself into business\\nand keep away from the hills the logical thing is to set out looking\\nfor another one my friend the pocket hunter had been looking twenty\\nyears his working outfit was a shovel a pick a gold pan which he\\nkept cleaner than his plate and a pocket magnifier when he came to a\\nwatercourse he would pan out the gravel of its bed for “colors” and\\nunder the glass determine if they had come from far or near and so\\nspying he would work up the stream until he found where the drift of\\nthe goldbearing outcrop fanned out into the creek then up the side\\nof the cañon till he came to the proper vein i think he said the best\\nindication of small pockets was an iron stain but i could never get\\nthe run of miner’s talk enough to feel instructed for pocket hunting\\nhe had another method in the waterless hills where he would work\\nin and out of blind gullies and all windings of the manifold strata\\nthat appeared not to have cooled since they had been heaved up his\\nitinerary began with the east slope of the sierras of the snows where\\nthat range swings across to meet the coast hills and all up that slope\\nto the truckee river country where the long cold forbade his progress\\nnorth then he worked back down one or another of the nearly parallel\\nranges that lie out desertward and so down to the sink of the mojave\\nriver burrowing to oblivion in the sanda big mysterious land a\\nlonely inhospitable land beautiful terrible but he came to no harm\\nin it the land tolerated him as it might a gopher or a badger of all\\nits inhabitants it has the least concern for

acceptable for his clean companionable talk\\nthere was more color to his reminiscences than the faded sandy old\\nminers “kyoteing” that is tunneling like a coyote kyote in the\\nvernacular in the core of a lonesome hill such a one has found\\nperhaps a body of tolerable ore in a poor leadremember that i can\\nnever be depended on to get the terms rightand followed it into the\\nheart of

remains on the body until death\\n\\nthe pocket hunter had seen destruction by the violence of nature and\\nthe violence of men and felt himself in the grip of an allwisdom\\nthat killed men or spared them as seemed for their good but of death\\nby sickness he knew nothing except that he believed he should never\\nsuffer it he had been in grapevine cañon the year of storms that\\nchanged the whole front of the mountain all day he had come down\\nunder the wing of the storm hoping to win past it but finding it\\ntraveling with him until night it kept on after that he supposed a\\nsteady downpour but could not with certainty say being securely deep\\nin sleep but the weather instinct does not sleep in the night the\\nheavens behind the hill dissolved in rain and the roar of the storm\\nwas borne in and mixed with his dreaming so that it moved him still\\nasleep to get up and out of the path of it what finally woke him was\\nthe crash of pine logs as they went down before the unbridled flood\\nand the swirl of foam that lashed him where he clung in the tangle of\\nscrub while the wall of water went by it went on against the cabin of\\nbill gerry and laid bill stripped and broken on a sand bar at the mouth\\nof the grapevine seven miles away there when the sun was up and the\\nwrath of the rain spent the pocket hunter found and buried him but he\\nnever laid his own escape at any

years\\nbefore it will break up sometimes bluehot and bubbling in the midst\\nof a clear creek or make a sucking scalding quicksand at the ford\\nthese outbreaks had the kind of morbid interest for the pocket hunter\\nthat a house of unsavory reputation has in a respectable neighborhood\\nbut i always found the accounts he brought me more interesting than\\nhis explanations which were compounded of fag ends of miner’s talk\\nand superstition he was a perfect gossip of the woods this pocket\\nhunter and when i could get him away from “leads” and “strikes” and\\n“contacts” full of fascinating small talk about the ebb and flood of\\ncreeks the piñon crop on black mountain and the wolves of mesquite\\nvalley i suppose he never knew how much he depended for the necessary\\nsense of home and companionship on the beasts and trees meeting and\\nfinding them in their wonted placesthe bear that used to come down\\npine creek in the spring pawing out trout from the shelters of sod\\nbanks the juniper at lone tree spring and the quail at paddy jack’s\\n\\nthere is a place on waban south of white mountain where flat\\nwindtilted cedars make low tents and coves of shade and shelter\\nwhere the wild sheep winter in the snow woodcutters and prospectors\\nhad brought me word of that but the pocket hunter was accessory to\\nthe fact about the opening of winter when one looks for sudden big\\nstorms he had attempted a crossing by the nearest path beginning the\\nascent at noon it grew cold the snow came on thick and blinding and\\nwiped out the trail in a white smudge the storm drift blew in and cut\\noff landmarks the early dark obscured the rising drifts according to\\nthe pocket hunter’s account he knew where he was but couldn’t exactly\\nsay three days before he had been in the west arm of death valley on\\na short water allowance ankle deep in shifty sand now he was on the\\nrise of waban kneedeep in sodden snow and in both cases he did the\\nonly allowable thinghe walked on that is the only thing to do in a\\nsnowstorm in any case it might have been the creature instinct which\\nin his way of life had room to grow that led him to the cedar shelter\\nat any rate he found it about four hours after dark and heard the\\nheavy breathing of the flock he said that if he thought at all at this\\njuncture he must have thought that he had stumbled on a stormbelated\\nshepherd with his silly sheep but in fact he took no note of anything\\nbut the warmth of packed fleeces and snuggled in between them dead\\nwith sleep if the flock stirred in the night he stirred drowsily to\\nkeep close and let the storm go by that was all until morning woke him\\nshining on a white world then the very soul of him shook to see the\\nwild sheep of god stand up about him nodding their great horns beneath\\nthe cedar roof looking out on the wonder of the snow they had moved a\\nlittle away from him with the coming of the light but paid him no more\\nheed the light broadened and the white pavilions of the snow swam in\\nthe heavenly blueness of the sea from which they rose the cloud drift\\nscattered and broke billowing in the cañons the leader stamped lightly\\non the litter to put the flock in motion suddenly they took the drifts\\nin those long light leaps that are nearest to flight down and away\\non the slopes of waban think of that to happen to a pocket hunter\\nbut though he had fallen on many a wishedfor hap he was curiously\\ninapt at getting the truth about beasts in general he believed in\\nthe venom of toads and charms for snake bites andfor this i could\\nnever forgive himhad all the miner’s prejudices against my friend the\\ncoyote thief sneak and son of a thief were the friendliest words he\\nhad for this little gray dog of the wilderness\\n\\nof course with so much seeking he came occasionally upon pockets of\\nmore or less value otherwise he could not have kept up his way of\\nlife but he had as much luck in missing great ledges as in finding\\nsmall ones he had been all over the tonopah country and brought away\\nfloat without happening upon anything that gave promise of what that\\ndistrict was to become in a few years he claimed to have chipped\\nbits off the very outcrop of the california rand without finding it\\nworth while to bring away but none of these things put him out of\\ncountenance\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nit was once in roving weather when we found him shifting pack on a\\nsteep trail that i observed certain of his belongings done up in green\\ncanvas bags the veritable “green bag” of english novels it seemed\\nso incongruous a reminder in this untenanted west that i dropped\\ndown beside the trail overlooking the vast dim valley to hear about\\nthe green canvas he had gotten it he said in london years before\\nand that was the first i had known of his having been abroad it was\\nafter one of his “big strikes” that he had made the grand tour and\\nhad brought nothing away from it but the green canvas bags which he\\nconceived would fit his needs and an ambition this last was nothing\\nless than to strike it rich and set himself up among the eminently\\nbourgeois of london it seemed that the situation of the wealthy\\nenglish middle class with just enough gentility above to aspire to\\nand sufficient smaller fry to bully and patronize appealed to his\\nimagination though of course he did not put it so crudely as that\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nit was no news to me then two or three years after to learn that he\\nhad taken ten thousand dollars from an abandoned claim just the sort\\nof luck to have pleased him and gone to london to spend it the land\\nseemed not to miss him any more than it had minded him but i missed\\nhim and could not forget the trick of expecting him in least likely\\nsituations therefore it was with a pricking sense of the familiar that\\ni followed a twilight trail of smoke a year or two later to the swale\\nof a dripping spring and came upon a man by the fire with a coffeepot\\nand fryingpan i was not surprised to find it was the pocket hunter\\nno man can be stronger than his destiny\\n\\nillustration\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshoshone land\\n\\nillustration\\n\\n\\nit is true i have been in shoshone land but before that long\\nbefore i had seen it through the eyes of winnenap´ in a rosy mist of\\nreminiscence and must always see it with a sense of intimacy in the\\nlight that never was sitting on the golden slope at the campoodie\\nlooking across the bitter lake to the purple tops of mutarango the\\nmedicineman drew up its happy places one by one like little blessed\\nislands in a sea of talk for he was born a shoshone was winnenap´\\nand though his name his wife his children and his tribal relations\\nwere of the paiutes his thoughts turned homesickly toward shoshone\\nland once a shoshone always a shoshone winnenap´ lived gingerly\\namong the paiutes and in his heart despised them but he could speak\\na tolerable english when he would and he always would if it were of\\nshoshone land\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nhe had come into the keeping of the paiutes as a hostage for the long\\npeace which the authority of the whites made interminable and though\\nthere was now no order in the tribe nor any power that could have\\nlawfully restrained him kept on in the old usage to save his honor\\nand the word of his vanished kin he had seen his children’s children\\nin the borders of the paiutes but loved best his own miles of sand\\nand rainbowpainted hills professedly he had not seen them since the\\nbeginning of his hostage but every year about the end of the rains and\\nbefore the strength of the sun had come upon us from the south the\\nmedicineman went apart on the mountains to gather herbs and when he\\ncame again i knew by the new fortitude of his countenance and the new\\ncolor of his reminiscences that he had been alone and unspied upon in\\nshoshone land\\n\\nto reach that country from the campoodie one goes south and south\\nwithin hearing of the lipliplapping of the great tideless lake\\nand south by east over a high rolling district miles and miles of\\nsage and nothing else so one comes to the country of the painted\\nhillsold red cones of craters wasteful beds of mineral earths hot\\nacrid springs and steam jets issuing from a leprous soil after the\\nhills the black rock after the craters the spewed lava ash strewn\\nof incredible thickness and full of sharp winding rifts there are\\npicture writings carved deep in the face of the cliffs to mark the way\\nfor those who do not know it on the very edge of the black rock the\\nearth falls away in a wide sweeping hollow which is shoshone land\\n\\nsouth the land rises in very blue hills blue because thickly wooded\\nwith ceanothus and manzanita the haunt of deer and the border of the\\nshoshones eastward the land goes very far by broken ranges narrow\\nvalleys of pure desertness and huge mesas uplifted to the skyline\\neast and east and no man knows the end of it\\n\\nit is the country of the bighorn the wapiti and the wolf nesting\\nplace of buzzards land of cloudnourished trees and wild things that\\nlive without drink above all it is the land of the creosote and the\\nmesquite the mesquite is god’s best thought in all this desertness it\\ngrows in the open is thorny stocky close grown and ironrooted\\nlong winds move in the draughty valleys blown sand fills and fills\\nabout the lower branches piling pyramidal dunes from the top of which\\nthe mesquite twigs flourish greenly fifteen or twenty feet under the\\ndrift where it seems no rain could penetrate the main trunk grows\\nattaining often a yard’s thickness resistant as oak in shoshone land\\none digs for large timber that is in the southerly sandy exposures\\nhigher on the tabletopped ranges low trees of juniper and piñon stand\\neach apart rounded and spreading heaps of greenness between them but\\neach to itself in smooth clear spaces tufts of tall feathered grass\\n\\nthis is the sense of the desert hills that there is room enough and\\ntime enough trees grow to consummate domes every plant has its\\nperfect work noxious weeds such as come up thickly in crowded fields\\ndo not flourish in the free spaces live long enough with an indian\\nand he or the wild things will show you a use for everything that grows\\nin these borders\\n\\nthe manner of the country makes the usage of life there and the land\\nwill not be lived in except in its own fashion the shoshones live\\nlike their trees with great spaces between and in pairs and in\\nfamily groups they set up wattled huts by the infrequent springs more\\nwickiups than two make a very great number their shelters are lightly\\nbuilt for they travel much and far following where deer feed and\\nseeds ripen but they are not more lonely than other creatures that\\ninhabit there\\n\\nthe year’s round is somewhat in this fashion after the piñon\\nharvest the clans foregather on a warm southward slope for the\\nannual adjustment of tribal difficulties and the medicine dance for\\nmarriage and mourning and vengeance and the exchange of serviceable\\ninformation if for example the deer have shifted their feeding\\nground if the wild sheep have come back to waban or certain springs\\nrun full or dry here the shoshones winter flockwise weaving baskets\\nand hunting big game driven down from the country of the deep snow\\nand this brief intercourse is all the use they have of their kind for\\nnow there are no wars and many of their ancient crafts have fallen\\ninto disuse the solitariness of the life breeds in the men as in the\\nplants a certain wellroundedness and sufficiency to its own ends\\nany shoshone family has in itself the manseed power to multiply\\nand replenish potentialities for food and clothing and shelter for\\nhealing and beautifying\\n\\nwhen the rain is over and gone they are stirred by the instinct of\\nthose that journeyed eastward from eden and go up each with his mate\\nand young brood like birds to old nesting places the beginning of\\nspring in shoshone landoh the soft wonder of itis a mistiness\\nas of incense smoke a veil of greenness over the whitish stubby\\nshrubs a web of color on the silver sanded soil no counting covers\\nthe multitude of rayed blossoms that break suddenly underfoot in the\\nbrief season of the winter rains with silky furred or prickly viscid\\nfoliage or no foliage at all they are morning and evening bloomers\\nchiefly and strong seeders years of scant rains they lie shut and\\nsafe in the winnowed sands so that some species appear to be extinct\\nyears of long storms they break so thickly into bloom that no horse\\ntreads without crushing them these years the gullies of the hills are\\nrank with fern and a great tangle of climbing vines\\n\\njust as the mesa twilights have their vocal note in the love call of\\nthe burrowing owl so the desert spring is voiced by the mourning\\ndoves welcome and sweet they sound in the smoky mornings before\\nbreeding time and where they frequent in any great numbers water is\\nconfidently looked for still by the springs one finds the cunning\\nbrush shelters from which the shoshones shot arrows at them when the\\ndoves came to drink\\n\\nnow as to these same shoshones there are some who claim that they\\nhave no right to the name which belongs to a more northerly tribe\\nbut that is the word they will be called by and there is no greater\\noffense than to call an indian out of his name according to their\\ntraditions and all proper evidence they were a great people occupying\\nfar north and east of their present bounds driven thence by the\\npaiutes between the two tribes is the residuum of old hostilities\\n\\nwinnenap´ whose memory ran to the time when the boundary of the paiute\\ncountry was a deadline to shoshones told me once how himself and\\nanother lad in an unforgotten spring discovered a nesting place of\\nbuzzards a bit of a way beyond the borders and they two burned to\\nrob those nests oh for no purpose at all except as boys rob nests\\nimmemorially for the fun of it to have and handle and show to other\\nlads as an exceeding treasure and afterwards discard so not quite\\nmeaning to but breathless with daring they crept up a gully across\\na sage brush flat and through a waste of boulders to the rugged pines\\nwhere their sharp eyes had made out the buzzards settling\\n\\nthe medicineman told me always with a quaking relish at this point\\nthat while they grown bold by success were still in the tree they\\nsighted a paiute hunting party crossing between them and their own\\nland that was midmorning and all day on into the dark the boys crept\\nand crawled and slid from boulder to bush and bush to boulder in\\ncactus scrub and on naked sand always in a sweat of fear until the\\ndust caked in the nostrils and the breath sobbed in the body around\\nand away many a mile until they came to their own land again and all\\nthe time winnenap´ carried those buzzard’s eggs in the slack of his\\nsingle buckskin garment young shoshones are like young quail knowing\\nwithout teaching about feeding and hiding and learning what civilized\\nchildren never learn to be still and to keep on being still at the\\nfirst hint of danger or strangeness\\n\\nas for food that appears to be chiefly a matter of being willing\\ndesert indians all eat chuckwallas big black and white lizards that\\nhave delicate white flesh savored like chicken both the shoshones and\\nthe coyotes are fond of the flesh of gopherus agassizii the turtle\\nthat by feeding on buds going without drink and burrowing in the sand\\nthrough the winter contrives to live a known period of twentyfive\\nyears it seems that most seeds are foodful in the arid regions most\\nberries edible and many shrubs good for firewood with the sap in\\nthem the mesquite bean whether the screw or straight pod pounded to\\na meal boiled to a kind of mush and dried in cakes sulphurcolored\\nand needing an axe to cut it is an excellent food for long journeys\\nfermented in water with wild honey and the honeycomb it makes a\\npleasant mildly intoxicating drink\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nnext to spring the best time to visit shoshone land is when the\\ndeerstar hangs low and white like a torch over the morning hills go\\nup past winnedumah and down saline and up again to the rim of mesquite\\nvalley take no tent but if you will have an indian build you a\\nwickiup willows planted in a circle drawn over to an arch and bound\\ncunningly with withes all the leaves on and chinks to count the stars\\nthrough but there was never any but winnenap´ who could tell and make\\nit worth telling about shoshone land\\n\\nand winnenap´ will not any more he died as do most medicinemen of\\nthe paiutes\\n\\nwhere the lot falls when the campoodie chooses a medicineman there\\nit rests it is an honor a man seldom seeks but must wear an honor\\nwith a condition when three patients die under his ministrations the\\nmedicineman must yield his life and his office wounds do not count\\nbroken bones and bullet holes the indian can understand but measles\\npneumonia and smallpox are witchcraft winnenap´ was medicineman for\\nfifteen years besides considerable skill in healing herbs he used his\\nprerogatives cunningly it is permitted the medicineman to decline the\\ncase when the patient has had treatment from any other say the white\\ndoctor whom many of the younger generation consult or if before\\nhaving seen the patient he can definitely refer his disorder to some\\nsupernatural cause wholly out of the medicineman’s jurisdiction say\\nto the spite of an evil spirit going about in the form of a coyote\\nand states the case convincingly he may avoid the penalty but this\\nmust not be pushed too far all else failing he can hide winnenap´\\ndid this the time of the measles epidemic returning from his yearly\\nherb gathering he heard of it at black rock and turning aside he was\\nnot to be found nor did he return to his own place until the disease\\nhad spent itself and half the children of the campoodie were in their\\nshallow graves with beads sprinkled over them\\n\\nit is possible the tale of winnenap´’s patients had not been strictly\\nkept there had not been a medicineman killed in the valley for twelve\\nyears and for that the perpetrators had been severely punished by the\\nwhites the winter of the big snow an epidemic of pneumonia carried off\\nthe indians with scarcely a warning from the lake northward to the\\nlava flats they died in the sweathouses and under the hands of the\\nmedicinemen even the drugs of the white physician had no power\\n\\nillustration arrival of the executioners\\n\\nafter two weeks of this plague the paiutes drew to council to consider\\nthe remissness of their medicinemen they were sore with grief and\\nafraid for themselves as a result of the council one in every\\ncampoodie was sentenced to the ancient penalty but schooling and\\nnative shrewdness had raised up in the younger men an unfaith in old\\nusages so judgment halted between sentence and execution at three\\npines the government teacher brought out influential whites to threaten\\nand cajole the stubborn tribes at tunawai the conservatives sent into\\nnevada for that pacific old humbug johnson sides most notable of\\npaiute orators to harangue his people citizens of the towns turned\\nout with food and comforts and so after a season the trouble passed\\n\\nbut here at maverick there was no school no oratory and no\\nalleviation one third of the campoodie died and the rest killed\\nthe medicinemen winnenap´ expected it and for days walked and sat\\na little apart from his family that he might meet it as became a\\nshoshone no doubt suffering the agony of dread deferred when finally\\nthree men came and sat at his fire without greeting he knew his time\\nhe turned a little from them dropped his chin upon his knees and\\nlooked out over shoshone land breathing evenly the women went into\\nthe wickiup and covered their heads with their blankets\\n\\nso much has the indian lost of savageness by merely desisting from\\nkilling that the executioners braved themselves to their work\\nby drinking and a show of quarrelsomeness in the end a sharp\\nhatchetstroke discharged the duty of the campoodie afterward his\\nwomen buried him and a warm wind coming out of the south the force of\\nthe disease was broken and even they acquiesced in the wisdom of the\\ntribe that summer they told me all except the names of the three\\n\\nsince it appears that we make our own heaven here no doubt we shall\\nhave a hand in the heaven of hereafter and i know what winnenap´’s\\nwill be like worth going to if one has leave to

have spilled out of squaw gulch and that in fact\\nis the sequence of its growth it began around the bully boy and\\ntheresa group of mines midway up squaw gulch spreading down to the\\nsmelter at the mouth of the ravine the freight wagons dumped their\\nloads as near to the mill as the slope allowed and jimville grew\\nin between above the gulch begins a pine wood with sparsely grown\\nthickets of lilac azalea and odorous blossoming shrubs\\n\\nsquaw gulch is a very sharp steep raggedwalled ravine and that\\npart of jimville which is built in it has only one streetin summer\\npaved with bonewhite cobbles in the wet months a frothy yellow flood\\nall between the ore dumps and solitary small cabins pieced out with\\ntin cans and packing cases run footpaths drawing down to the silver\\ndollar saloon when jimville was having the time of its life the silver\\ndollar had those same coins let into the bar top for a border but the\\nproprietor pried them out when the glory departed there are three\\nhundred inhabitants in jimville and four bars though you are not to\\nargue anything from that\\n\\nhear now how jimville came by its name jim calkins discovered the\\nbully boy jim baker located the theresa when jim jenkins opened an\\neatinghouse in his tent he chalked up on the flap “best meals in\\njimville 100” and the name stuck\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nthere was more human interest in the origin of squaw gulch though it\\ntickled no humor it was dimmick’s squaw from aurora way if dimmick\\nhad been anything except new englander he would have called her a\\nmahala but that would not have bettered his behavior dimmick made a\\nstrike went east and the squaw who had been to him as his wife took\\nto drink that was the bald way of stating it in the aurora

heartened her for the\\nend buried her and walked back to poso eighteen miles the child\\npoking in the folds of his denim shirt with small mewing noises and\\nwon support for it from the roughhanded

ground as you can shoot over\\nin as many pretensions as you can make good\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nthat probably explains mr fanshawe the gentlemanly faro dealer of\\nthose parts built for the rôle of oakhurst going whiteshirted and\\nfrockcoated in a community of overalls and persuading you that\\nwhatever shifts and tricks of the game were laid to his deal he\\ncould not practice them on a person of your penetration but he does\\nby his own account and the evidence of his manners he had been bred\\nfor a clergyman and he certainly has gifts for the part you find\\nhim always in possession of

of calaveras and some others of that stripe his\\nimproprieties had a certain sanction of long standing not accorded to\\nthe gay ladies who wore mr fanshawe’s favors there were perhaps too\\nmany of them on the whole the point of the moral distinctions of\\njimville appears to be a point of honor with an absence of humorous\\nappreciation that strangers mistake for dullness at jimville they see\\nbehavior as history and judge it by facts untroubled by invention and\\nthe dramatic sense you glimpse a crude equity in their dealings with\\nwilkins who had shot a man at lone tree fairly in an open quarrel\\nrumor of it reached jimville before wilkins rested there in flight i\\nsaw wilkins all jimville saw him in fact he came into the silver\\ndollar when we were holding a church fair and bought a pink silk\\npincushion i have often wondered what became of it some of us shook\\nhands with him not because we did not know but because we had not\\nbeen officially notified and there were those present who knew how\\nit was themselves when the sheriff arrived wilkins had moved on and\\njimville organized a posse and brought him back because the sheriff\\nwas a jimville man and we had to stand by him\\n\\ni said we had the church fair at the silver dollar we had most things\\nthere dances town meetings and the kinetoscope exhibition of the\\npassion play the silver dollar had been built when the borders of\\njimville spread from minton to the red hill the defiance twisted\\nthrough “sidewinder” smith scrubbed the floor for us and moved the\\nbar to the back room the fair was designed for the support of the\\ncircuit rider who preached to the few that would hear and buried us\\nall in turn he was the symbol of jimville’s respectability although\\nhe was of a sect that held dancing among the cardinal sins the\\nmanagement took no chances on offending the minister at 1130 they\\ntendered him the receipts of the evening in the chairman’s hat as a\\ndelicate intimation that the fair was closed the company filed out of\\nthe front door and around to the back then the dance began formally\\nwith no feelings hurt these were the sort of courtesies common enough\\nin jimville that brought tears of delicate inner laughter\\n\\nthere were others besides mr fanshawe who had walked out of mr\\nharte’s demesne to jimville and wore names that smacked of the\\nsoil“alkali bill” “pike” wilson “three finger” and “mono jim”\\nfierce shy profane sundried derelicts of the windy hills who each\\nowned or had owned a mine and was wishful to own one again they\\nlaid up on the worn benches of the silver dollar or the same old luck\\nlike beached vessels and their talk ran on endlessly of “strike” and\\n“contact” and “mother lode” and worked around to fights and holdups\\nvillainy haunts and the hoodoo of the minietta told austerely\\nwithout imagination\\n\\ndo not suppose i am going to repeat it all you who want these things\\nwritten up from the point of view of people who do not do them every\\nday would get no savor in their speech\\n\\nsays three finger relating the history of the mariposa “i took it\\noff’n tom beatty cheap after his brother bill was shot”\\n\\nsays jim jenkins “what was the matter of him”\\n\\n“who bill abe johnson shot him he was fooling around johnson’s wife\\nan’ tom sold me the mine dirt cheap”\\n\\n“why didn’t he work it himself”\\n\\n“him oh he was laying for abe and calculated to have to leave the\\ncountry pretty quick”\\n\\n“huh” says jim jenkins and the tale flows smoothly on\\n\\nyearly the spring fret floats the loose population of jimville out\\ninto the desolate waste hot lands guiding by the peaks and a few\\nrarely touched waterholes always always with the golden hope they\\ndevelop prospects and grow rich develop others and grow poor but\\nnever embittered say the hills it is all one there is gold enough\\ntime enough and men enough to come after you and at jimville they\\nunderstand the language of the hills\\n\\njimville does not know a great deal about the crust of the earth it\\nprefers a “hunch” that is an intimation from the gods that if you go\\nover a brown back of the hills by a dripping spring up coso way you\\nwill find what is worth while i have never heard that the failure of\\nany particular hunch disproved the principle somehow the rawness of\\nthe land favors the sense of personal relation to the supernatural\\nthere is not much intervention of crops cities clothes and manners\\nbetween you and the organizing forces to cut off communication all\\nthis begets in jimville a state that passes explanation unless you\\nwill accept an explanation that passes belief along with killing\\nand drunkenness coveting of women charity simplicity there is\\na certain indifference blankness emptiness if you will of all\\nvaporings no bubbling of the potit wants the german to coin a word\\nfor thatno breadenvy no brotherfervor western

did st jerome in the desert so\\nalso in the elder day did gods life its performance cessation is no\\nnew thing to gape and wonder at\\n\\nhere you have the repose of the perfectly accepted instinct which\\nincludes passion and death in its perquisites i suppose that the end\\nof all our hammering and yawping will be something like the point of\\nview of jimville the only difference will be in the decorations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmy neighbor’s field\\n\\nillustration\\n\\n\\nit is one of those places god must have meant for a field from all\\ntime lying very level at the foot of the slope that crowds up against\\nkearsarge falling slightly toward the town north and south it is\\nfenced by low old glacial ridges boulder strewn and untenable\\neastward it butts on orchard closes and the village gardens brimming\\nover into them by wild brier and creeping grass the village street\\nwith its double row of unlike houses breaks off abruptly at the edge\\nof the field in a footpath that goes up the streamside beyond it to\\nthe source of waters\\n\\nthe field is not greatly esteemed of the town not being put to the\\nplough nor affording firewood but breeding all manner of wild seeds\\nthat go down in the irrigating ditches to come up as weeds in the\\ngardens and grass plots but when i had no more than seen it in the\\ncharm of its spring smiling i knew i should have no peace until i had\\nbought ground and built me a house beside it with a little wicket to\\ngo in and out at all hours as afterward came about\\n\\nedswick roeder connor and ruffin owned the field before it fell to\\nmy neighbor but before that the paiutes mesne lords of the soil made\\na campoodie by the rill of pine creek and after contesting the soil\\nwith them cattlemen who found its foodful pastures greatly to their\\nadvantage and bands of blethering flocks shepherded by wild hairy\\nmen of little speech who attested their rights to the feeding ground\\nwith their long staves upon each other’s skulls edswick homesteaded\\nthe field about the time the wild tide of mining life was roaring and\\nrioting up kearsarge and where the village now stands built a stone\\nhut with loopholes to make good his claim against cattlemen or\\nindians but edswick died and roeder became master of the field roeder\\nowned cattle on a thousand hills and made it a recruiting ground for\\nhis bellowing herds before beginning the long drive to market across a\\nshifty desert he kept the field fifteen years and afterward falling\\ninto difficulties put it out as security against certain sums connor\\nwho held the securities was cleverer than roeder and not so busy the\\nmoney fell due the winter of the big snow when all the trails were\\nforty feet under drifts and roeder was away in san francisco selling\\nhis cattle at the set time connor took the law by the forelock and\\nwas adjudged possession of the field eighteen days later roeder\\narrived on snowshoes both feet frozen and the money in his pack in\\nthe long suit at law ensuing the field fell to ruffin that clever\\nonearmed lawyer with the tongue to wile a bird out of the bush\\nconnor’s counsel and was sold by him to my neighbor whom from envying\\nhis possession i call naboth\\n\\nillustration\\n\\ncuriously all this human occupancy of greed and mischief left no mark\\non the field but the indians did and the unthinking sheep round its\\ncorners children pick up chipped arrow points of obsidian scattered\\nthrough it are kitchen middens and pits of old sweathouses by the\\nsouth corner where the campoodie stood is a single shrub of “hoopee”\\nlycium andersonii maintaining itself hardly among alien shrubs\\nand near by three low rakish trees of hackberry so far from home that\\nno prying of mine has been able to find another in any cañon east or\\nwest but the berries of both were food for the paiutes eagerly sought\\nand traded for as far south as shoshone land by the fork of the creek\\nwhere the shepherds camp is a single clump of mesquite of the variety\\ncalled “screw bean” the seed must have shaken there from some sheep’s\\ncoat for this is not the habitat of mesquite and except for other\\nsingle shrubs at sheep camps none grows freely for a hundred and fifty\\nmiles south or east\\n\\nnaboth has put a fence about the best of the field but neither the\\nindians nor the shepherds can quite forego it they make camp and build\\ntheir wattled huts about the borders of it and no doubt they have\\nsome sense of home in its familiar aspect\\n\\nas i have said it is a

inside\\nand out the palm finds no fault with them but the subtlest appeal is\\nin the sense that warns us of humanness in the way the design spreads\\ninto the flare of the bowl there used to be an indian woman at olancha\\nwho made bottleneck trinket baskets in the rattlesnake pattern and\\ncould accommodate the design to the swelling bowl and flat shoulder of\\nthe basket without sensible disproportion and so cleverly that you\\nmight own one a year without thinking how it was done but seyavi’s\\nbaskets had a touch beyond cleverness the weaver and the warp lived\\nnext to the earth and were saturated with the same elements twice a\\nyear in the time of white butterflies and again when young quail ran\\nneck and neck in the chaparral seyavi cut willows for basketry by\\nthe creek where it wound toward the river against the sun and sucking\\nwinds it never quite reached the river except in farbetween times\\nof summer flood but it always tried and the willows encouraged it\\nas

trout begin to leap\\nthe end of the piñon harvest about the beginning of deep snows so\\nthey get nearer the sense of the season which runs early or late\\naccording as the rains are forward or delayed but whenever seyavi\\ncut willows for baskets was always a golden time and the soul of the\\nweather went into the wood if you had ever owned one of seyavi’s\\ngolden russet cooking bowls with the pattern of plumed quail you would\\nunderstand all this without saying anything\\n\\nbefore seyavi made baskets for the satisfaction of desirefor that is\\na housebred theory of art that makes

her young son with meadowlarks’\\ntongues to make him quick of speech but in late years was loath to\\nadmit it though she had come through the period of unfaith in the lore\\nof the clan with a fine

While I didn't mean to leave punctuation like quotation marks in the text, it is interesting to consider the implications here. Quotation marks in writing have various meanings; they can indicate sarcasm, uncertainty, and dialogue. When I recall Rawson and Muñoz on data cleaning, these are the kinds of nuances lost when sorting for stop words. If I filter out punctuation that can indicate tone, will I dimish my ability to analyze the text and infer meaning? Leaving the quotation marks in (accidentally) may have given me insight into structure and tone that I didn't anticipate."

    "Now I have this information in a dataframe. Before I proceed to the next task, I see another artifact from the punctuation removal; the 's indicating possession or as a contraction. On one hand it's probably a useless artifact of my earlier processing. On the other hand, if it does indicate possession, as of the land, this fits a settler mindset. When I return to my research questions, I wonder if the frequency of the possessive means that nature writers were seeking ownership of the environment even as they claimed (double entendre here) to protect/preserve it. The realtionship of people to nature was one that ranged from stewardship to ownership. Kevin Bruyneel has argued that a part of settler memory is white settler masculinity, to which white settler women often contributed. It focused on protection of the domestic realm, which put settlers at odds with Indigenous peoples and the environment as perceived obstacles. In this case, using digital tools to target the frequency of language (punctuation) actually reveals a subtext to the stories' themes - man's supremacy over nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's just say that the quotation marks and possessive/contraction isn't helpful to this project and I want to focus on just word frequency. I can always save the old version of the dataframe with the quotation marks and possessive/contraction and create a new dataframe with them removed. I could also create and index for the new dataframe, per Rawson and Muñoz."

    "So here I see that after make then find, water, little, and illustration are my top words, but they really drop off after illustration. Little and water make sense to these short stories within The Land of Little Rain, however I am not sure what this might imply towards changing views of the environment, nature or settler mindset. So far as the themes of the book - the supremacy and divinity of nature, the negative consequences of the disconnect between humans and nature, and the positive consequences of the harmony between humans and nature - I can see aridity as an exacerbation of these dynamics - little, water. Other frequent words related to water include; spring, pine (as a plant that needs water), snow, wind (as an element that diminishes moisture), rain, well (could be an adverb or a source of water), lake, and desert (as a place lacking water).\n",
    "\n",
    "People are present; man (but not woman), jimville (the name of a town), shoshone (a Native tribe). However, animals are few; coyote at under 50 mentions. When it comes to the tension between people and nature, I wonder if this distribution actually indicates a greater tension between different peoples; men, settler communities, and Indigenous people. I certainly don't see the \"supremacy and divinity of nature\" here unless the verbs lower down the line might modify our understanding of the people so frequently mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the frequency of illustration, by opening the original document I can see that it is punctuated by the word illustration in substitution for illustrations appearing in the print copy. This indicates 83 separate illustrations for a book that is only 157 pages. Revisiting the idea of who the audience was and what the circulation of this text was like, illustating a book like this indicates a popular audience rather than elite. Further, studies on settler imagination links nature photography with colonization. Where landscapes are \"pristine,\" they erase indigeneity."

This means that I am only passing a column of single words, as opposed to a column text with topics. In a future project I might run this topic modeling off of other Mary Austin texts or off of other 19th/early 20th century female, California authors. Helen Hunt Jackson is another writer available through Project Gutenberg. There is another option to split the entirety of The Land of Little Rain into independent texts."

    "So what can textual analysis targeting the frequency of language signal about the text’s core themes; the supremacy and divinity of nature, the negative consequences of the disconnect between humans and nature, and the positive consequences of the harmony between humans and nature?\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency of certain words appears to confirm what we already know from the title. The author, Mary Austin, is writing about a land shaped by aridity, \"the land of little rain.\" Other frequent words relate to water, including spring, pine (as a plant that needs water), snow, wind (as an element that diminishes moisture), rain, well (could be an adverb or a source of water), lake, and desert (as a place lacking water). The mention of specific animals are fewer than mentions of various people; coyote comes in first at under 50 mentions. It could be that there is a great variety of animals, but few repeaters. When it comes to the tension between people and nature as a theme, this distribution actually indicates a greater tension between different peoples than the \"supremacy and divinity of nature.\" Looking at this process as a whole I can see that punctuation can sometimes indicate meaning in a text and one has to be careful not to clean all of the nuance out of a document. Grammar like contractions or the possessive might likewise confer meaning and should add to the caution advised by Rawson and Muñoz when cleaning data. In this case, using digital tools to target the frequency of language (punctuation) actually reveals a subtext to the stories' themes - man's supremacy over nature - if we consider the proliferation of dialogue in the form of quotation marks and the possessive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the influence of Austin’s work, and her own evolution in thinking about the California environment, what can The Land of Little Rain tell us about changing attitudes towards the environment, and the relationship of people to nature, at the turn of the century?\n",
    "\n",
    "Curiously this is a place wher data feminism and the projections of feminism on Austin herself run counter to expectations. People are present in her stories, but overwhelmingly male; man (but not woman) and jimville (the name of a town). To apply the principles of data feminism as D'Ignazio and Klein suggest is to note the absence of women and its implications of the male as default, that is certainly the case here. Austin wrote at a time when female writers were viewed as to0 dramatic, flowery, and sentimental for serious nature writing. Austin was praised for her reserve in writing about nature, a masculine attribute. It could be that Austin adopted this tone and the accompanying language to facilitate her message of conservation across a wider audience. Also, colonization is often gendered male; miners, prospectors, pioneers, cowboys, etc. These are the men who scarred the land with their exraction of resources. Early environmentalists saw this as the enemy of nature and conservation. However, this also provides a cover for the role of (white) women in settler colonialism. Removing Indigenous people to create a \"pristine\" natural environment was also an act of colonization. At the turn of the century, this writing would have been at the forefront of views on nature and the environment."
