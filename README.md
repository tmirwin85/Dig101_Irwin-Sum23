California literature includes extensive writings on the topic of the environment, American settlers, and Native peoples. The common theme of aridity unites all three. Mary Hunter Austin was an early nature writer of the American Southwest, best known for her book The Land of Little Rain, published in 1903. She came to the San Joaquin Valley with her family in 1888 and subsequently wrote about her experiences. Her writing reflects her interests in the Mojave desert, the aridity of the California environment, debates around California water rights, and Native American rights. Austin’s work today reveals changing attitudes at the turn of the century around the environment, the place of Native peoples, and conservation. Literature often reflects the society it was constructed in and then goes on to shape future generations. Looking at The Land of Little Rain helps to enhance these understandings and consider how this text scripted attitudes towards the environment of California and California Indians. Much has been made about Austin’s progressive stance on the environment and Native people, but her writings reinforced harmful stereotypes about “the vanishing Indian” and “the ecological Indian” that persist today. To a degree, Austin’s brand of environmentalism did not consider Indigenous sovereignty and Native land management as a part of conservation. Because this language is inherent to settler memory, as they are not produced by nature or Native people, these findings have broader implications for the study of settler colonialism in the American West. Using digital technology to parse the writings elucidates these impacts.
